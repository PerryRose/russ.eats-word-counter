Righto. So, people drive to Redfern every day for some Crystal, but not Crystal fuckin' Pepsi. This is the rarest thing I'll ever try on this page. This is one of only five bottles that are in date in Australia. Thank you to Hazim from the greatest Redfern convenience store on Earth. He allocated me one of these. I'm fuckin' blown away. Gave me a shirt. Look at us having a fuckin' great time. I'm keen. A bit of history. In the 90s, people wanted more natural, pure, caffeine-free soda options. Crystal Pepsi was both. It had one of the biggest product launches in history, but then less than two years later, it was fuckin' gone from the shelves and dubbed one of the biggest product failures of all time. So why'd this fail? Basically, good product, bad execution. People didn't know why they fuckin' needed a Crystal Pepsi. They were confused, and the shelf life was shit. A clear drink is usually in a tinted bottle. Sprite? Green bottle. The sun fucked these, and apparently the flavour really deteriorated quickly. Apparently fresh bottles like this one are fuckin' awesome though, so let's give it a go. Let's go. Ooh. Comparison sip. That's fuckin' mad. The only way I can describe it is it's like a normal Pepsi, way less acidic, and tastes fresher. Like it leaves a pleasant aftertaste, like a good cold cup of water sensation. Nine out of ten, you're just gonna have to believe me, because I've got one of the only fuckin' bottles. Suck shit.
