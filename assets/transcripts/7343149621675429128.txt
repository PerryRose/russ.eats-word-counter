Righto, I'm on a bit of a health kick, so I'm thinking to keep the momentum going, I'll do some healthier reviews, some exotic fruit. I'm turning 30 in June and at such a weird age, right, 40% are absolutely fucked, they can't even walk up a flight of stairs without getting a fucking stitch. The other 40% are running marathons, and then there's a couple of us, just like me, that are somewhere in the middle. Let's start with the kiwi berry, apparently it's exactly what it sounds like, a kiwi fruit in berry form. And I need to get something off my chest, if you eat the skin of a kiwi fruit, you're fucking weird. I don't mind a bit of fur, but I don't want the kiwi fruit fur. Anyway, have a look, you get everything on the internet these days, even how to care for it like it's a little Nintendog. Sorry, forgot to eat it. Okay, that is cool, that literally is a kiwi fruit in berry form. Maybe a little bit of a bitter aftertaste, but that is fucking mad. It was $5.50 for only that many, but that's like an 8.5 out of 10, that is sick. It's Wet Sultana time, apparently this is natural too, they've somehow done it through crossbreeding, nothing artificial about it, but anyway. Okay, you've got to be kidding me, that's one of the best fruits I've ever had. A tangelo is still my number one, but that is literally a fairy floss super duper that's been like soaked into a grape. That is fucking incredible, 9.5 out of 10, that is fucking delicate.
