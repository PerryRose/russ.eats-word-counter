Righto, breaking news, I'm fucking scared. There's rumours going around that V has changed its formula. This started a couple of weeks ago when people were messaging me saying that it's happened, and then I've seen this New Zealand article saying packaging and flavour revamped for the first time in 26 years. I've been lucky enough to find one of each can, obviously we're going to do a taste test in about two fucking seconds, but it is confirmed, they are different. The kilojoules, sugar, sodium is different on the green, and just the kilojoules on the blue. Ingredients seem the same, but there's definitely been a change. Let's do it. Let's kick it off with the OG and the Impostor. They're fucking different, this is fucked. This is big fucking news. This has that classic V twang, where this has like an apple sweetness. They are similar, but they're fucking different. Oh no, oh no. Didn't they learn from this nightmare? You don't go fucking with an original. If you keep the original and bring out like a spin-off, that's okay, but you don't take away the original. This is fucked, let's do the blue. And the Impostor. Okay, blue is safe, I can't taste any noticeable difference, which is alright, because that's actually the one I prefer, but this, this tastes like an Aldi spin-off. It's similar, but it's not the same. Get fucked, this is big news. This is an absolute disaster.
