Righto, it's a Friday night and you know I like to have a little bit of cheeky piss and I've finally got my hands on the great Bubblegum Billsons. I had to ring up the hour that they did a Facebook post that they arrived to get a four-pack put aside and they fucking sold out in a couple of hours which is incredible. Anyway, let's do it. Now it smells exactly like grape Maximus I reckon. I've had people say it tastes like grape Gatorade, some say it tastes like grape Hubba Bubba, some one even said it tasted like grape and shit which surprised me. One way to find out. That's fucking yum. That makes this look like a piece of shit. When I reviewed this I gave it a 7.5 but once I finished the can I regretted my decision so I'm sorry. This is a 5 out of 10, this is an 8.5. It's like carbonated grape Gatorade mixed with Hubba Bubba. It's a fucking treat. I love it.
