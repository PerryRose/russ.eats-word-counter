Righto, the new Mars bar, honeycomb with salted caramel. I'm going to start with a fun fact that you'll thank me for if you ever travel to America. So the Mars bar that we have here in Australia and the UK is called the Milky Way in America. But the Milky Way we have here is called the Three Musketeers in America. Fucking confusing. The only time they've had a Mars bar in America was this and it is the same as an Almond Snickers and it was replaced by an Almond Snickers. Let's open her up. There's the cut. I left the skin on for this one. In all seriousness now, it looks pretty fucking good. You got caramel at the top that I'm assuming salted and then you've got a honeycomb nougat. Nougat, however the fuck you say it. Let's go. Yeah, that's pretty good. I'm giving that a 7 out of 10. It's not mind blowing, but it's exactly what it says it is. It's a classic Mars bar experience and you get like a honeycomb hint. Not too much honeycomb and then it just tastes like normal Mars caramel but with a little bit of salt at the end that makes your mouth water that you then want more if that fucking makes sense. So pretty good. Good experience.
