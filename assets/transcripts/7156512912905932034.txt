Righto, Neapolitan Oak Thickshake. Now I love the thickshake range because it reminds me of the old brown super shakes. What the fuck happened to these? These were mad. Personally, I thought the brown super shakes were better than the oak thickshakes. And fuck, these make me feel so sick when I finish one, which I'm probably gonna. But Neapolitan, mad flavor choice. Aldi actually did this first with the Neapolitan Ram. It just tasted like melted ice cream. I loved it. Neapolitan, though, reminds me of when me and my best mate Micka made a Neapolitan nightmare video like 10 years ago. When you open up the Neapolitan and there's only vanilla. I'm actually just gonna fucking find it. You kidding me, mate? What? You're fucking kidding me, mate. What? I promise you, that was peak comedy back then. I shot that on either a Nokia E63 or an iPhone 3GS. I'm not sure which part of life that was. Anyway, let's give it a go. Well, it's thick. Custard thick. I can't really fault that. That's a fucking dessert. That is, that's a treat. That is exactly like melted ice cream, but even more than the Aldi milk because it's thick. Give it a go. It's exactly what it says it is. Eight and a half? Maybe a nine? Eight and a half. 8.75.
