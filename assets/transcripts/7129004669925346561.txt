Righto, the junk food graveyard part 5, we're doing lollies. So Coles and Woolies are to blame for this, back in 2018 they killed the whole Starburst range except the Chews. You could still get them at 7-Eleven but now I cannot find the originals fucking anywhere. The originals I'm talking about are the Sucks lollipops, the snakes, the babies and the fruitful mix. I just think they had a little bit more tang than other lollies and still to this day I think they're the best fucking lolly ever to hit this country. I also wanted to mention Starburst Jelly Beans, the little Starburst writing on them and of course I have to mention Squirts again because they are still the ultimate lolly of all time. Next we've got the original Toffee Apple up the top. These were like Redskin texture and they were so fucking hard to chew through but they changed to Wonka and I so did Redskin and I swear they were just too easy to chew through when they changed and it just took away, took away the fun. The one thing Wonka did do right was the Nerdalicious and the Sour Nerds Fabulicious. Fuck, these were incredible. Fun fact about the Fabulicious range, you can still get the Sherbet Fizz. In New Zealand when they relaunched recently they kept the name but in Australia they named them Lifesaver Sticks. These are the same fucking thing. Last but not least, remember Cheeky Tongue lollies? I still think these were better than Ghost Drops even though I may be the reason they're discontinued. I got a full fucking nail through one after footy at Barrow back in under 14s and we complained and I actually haven't seen him since.
