Right-o, Violet Crumble Raspberry Twist, Australia's oldest chocolate bar. I love it when there's two products that cause a divide and a lot of arguments. Coke, Pepsi, Violet Crumble and Crunchy is another one. Just like Xbox and PlayStation, Apple, Samsung, you fucking know it. Sorry to get off topic, but I just realized this was in the screenshot I just used. What the fuck? Candy bar wrappers as condoms. Sydney, Australia, wrappers from Crunchy and Cadbury Violet Crumble, reportedly used as condoms by a 12-year-old, donated by Dr. Graham Ritter. I'd be asking questions why the fuck Dr. Graham had a 12-year-old Choccy Dom and Cadbury Violet Crumble. That's wrong. It's Cadbury Crunchy, you fucking idiot. Anyways, Violet Crumble is an Australian icon. It's not Steve Irwin, it's just below Milo, well above Delta Goodrum, and I wouldn't say it's a Vegemite. An Australian invention in 1913. It was then purchased by Nestle in 1988, where they sent it to the junk food graveyard in 2010. It's now back in Australian hands, where robin men's resuscitated it back in 2018. Since then, they've went skits with new Violet Crumble products. All right, I'm gonna shut up and actually review these fucking things. Oh, that punched me in the face. Let's go. So it looks cool as fuck, but it's full on sweet, like it's an expert level sweet treat. The outside tastes like the Raspberry Smash or the Red Skinned Oak, and overall it's giving me like Neapolitan ice cream vibes. 7 out of 10. I reckon you'll either love it or you'll hate it.
