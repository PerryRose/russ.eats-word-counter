Righto, the hunt for festive piss continues, and this one is fucking festive. A lemon meringue Billsons, but dessert-flavoured shit can be really hard to nail. Billsons have had a few dessert-flavoured things, I didn't mind these two, I hated Leamington, and I didn't try Pumpkin Spice, but it's up and down. And this can be replicated in the vape world. Now I fucking hate vapes, and yes, sometimes when I'm drunk I smoke one, but they scare the shit out of me, because I don't know what they're gonna do to ya, but I'm patient zero, okay? I used to vape back like fucking seven or eight years ago, when you had like the Nokia phone-sized vape, and from experience, the dessert-flavoured ones, that's what I'm getting at, okay, I'm not going off-topic, it's related, the dessert-flavoured ones tasted like shit, and there's something about them that is replicated in the drinks. If you want proof that vapes are bad for ya, I'm only 17 years old, this is just what it's fucking done to me, that is me on the front cover, okay? Patient zero. Anyways, let's get on with the hunt, because we probably won't make next Christmas when we find out vapes are the next fucking asbestos, anyway. Okay, let's kick it off. Is it the festive piece of choice? No. But what it is, is it's a conversation starter, so grab a couple of cans, and it will trigger some conversation with that family member that you've got nothing in fucking common with. But for flavour, it's odd, not as sweet as I thought, and it's pretty accurate, you get like a lolly lemon, then meringue, a little bit of base, but the aftertaste is odd, I can't put my finger on it, it almost tastes like you can taste the vodka, which is not, that's not normal for a Bilsons. It's okay, 6 out of 10, it's fun, okay? It's a bit of fun.
