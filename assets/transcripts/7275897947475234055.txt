Righto, Fanta are back with another mystery flavour. I can't say I'm keen because last year's was absolutely fucked. So this was last year's, which I said wasn't even a fucking beverage. I said it was a toiletry, that's how bad it was. I said it was creaming soda and toffee apple mixed with Windex piss and shit and it got a 3 out of 10. The flavour was actually pineapple, strawberry and cucumber. Who the fuck wants cucumber in their fizzy drink? Can they redeem themselves? Okay, it's only a 4 out of 10. It's only slightly better than the other one. The sugar-free taste in Fanta is honestly like a cleaning product. It is fucked. My guess though is I'm getting like a creamy flavour but also a fruity flavour. So either a strawberries and cream cherry or a cherry vanilla is my guess, mixed with piss, shit and gumption. I reckon there's some gumption in there. It's pretty fucking rough.
