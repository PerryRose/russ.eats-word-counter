Righto, you might have missed the scandal that my Sticky Date review was actually an apple and cinnamon hot cross bun. They fucked up at Baker's Delight and gave me the wrong one. I'm disappointed that I didn't pick up on that, but I don't really eat dates. I'm obviously a prune guy, okay? Look at me, I'm a fuckin' prune guy. Now, it was actually Baker's Delight that picked up on this, and they offered to send me some buns. Now, I did offer to pick these up myself, as the shop's over a minute around the fuckin' corner, but I forgot that Baker's Delight hates the fuckin' environment. That's why they've still got plastic bread clips. Anyway, this is what they're supposed to look like behind me. Definitely dates. I don't know how I fucked that up. Anyways, double or nothin', raw dog at first. Yeah, okay, way better. I do stand by my fuckin' opinion that the apple and cinnamon are shit, though. Cold with butter, and hot with butter. Okay, I'm giving that a 6.5 out of 10. The reason it's not scoring higher—it is delicious, by the way—is because it's not Sticky Date. It's not that toffee, Sticky Date, Sara Lee. It's just a date scone-style hot cross bun. If you like date scones, you'll fuckin' love it. If you like Sticky Date with all the toffee and shit, you'll be disappointed.
