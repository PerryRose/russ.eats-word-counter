Righto, the Milo McFlurry's finally landed. A lot of people are saying it's just Milo and ice cream, it's boring, it's too simple, but sometimes simple is best. But, if anyone's gonna fuck up simple, it's gonna be Macca's, so let's do it. Hey, can I please get the new Milo McFluffy? Can I get that in vanilla, and then one in chocolate, the chocolate yum yum? Yep. Oh, that's all, thank you. Oh, good, yeah, sure thing. Cheers. Let's have a look at them. I actually got a fair bit of topping. Usually, Macca's is stingy, but I was probably just lucky, okay, so yours probably won't look like this. But if I was making them, I'd go a ratio of one teaspoon ice cream to a full fucking jar. I wanna choke on the Milo. I wanna need a puff on an asthma puffer between every bite. Also, fucking station again. Kicking off with the OG. Yep, exactly as I predicted, it tastes just like this, the number one dessert in Australian history. Fuck the Leamington, I am gonna give it an eight and a half though, not a ten, because it's four bucks where this is about ten cents a serve. And the choccy yum yum. Nah, not as good as the OG, too much chocolate, I'm gonna give that one a six out of ten, nah, nah.
