Righto, the hunt for Festive Piss continues, this time we have a Grog sequel by Cold Ones. Now, Festive Piss doesn't have to be Christmas flavoured, it can also be like summer flavoured, like what you sink around the pool and shit, okay? So that's what category this comes under. Now, the Grog product is made by two YouTubers, and to be honest, it's probably the only like, influencer YouTuber product that isn't shit. I fucking loved the grape, it was like grape Gatorade. The peach was alright, like a peach iced tea. It's a 6% shoku vodka and soda, similar to your Suntory's. Now, the 6% low sugar market is saturated with lemon drinks, but I don't mind a lemon party. That's actually why I got into aged care, so one more won't hurt. Holy fuck, that has taken me by surprise. The lemon ice should have given it away. It's not a lemon squash flavour, it's a fucking lemonade icy pole, like a Lil' Lemonade Rugrats ice block and a Suntory of Had a Baby. That is going to be a very naughty little treat around the pool. I'm giving that a 9 out of 10. That could be the drink of the summer, but they did just bring out 6% fruit tangle fucking Billsons, so I'm not going to call it this early.
