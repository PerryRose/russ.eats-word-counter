Right-o, Dare is back with a new butterscotch latte flavour. I got this in the 750ml bottle, which I now refer to as the arse clencher, by the way. I'm only going to have a couple of sips because I've just had a shower. For the record, drinking coffee directly after a shower is the equivalent of going forward driving straight after washing your car. You just don't do it. So Dare's new flavours have been following all the coffee syrup flavours. There's not many left that they can do. There's a dirty chai Dare, which I'd love to see. Salted caramel, bit boring, we're over it. Irish cream Dare, would be mad. And a macadamia Dare, couldn't really care. Let's go. This is in between the espresso and double espresso. It's one and a half strength, by the way. Let's give it a go. Ooh, that smells like a little treat. I don't mind that. Very similar to the toffee nut, but without that sus nut aftertaste. I'm going to give that a fucking 7.5 out of 10. Sweet butterscotch, classic Dare flavour. I reckon give it a go. Nice and strong.
