Righto, Marvellous Creations Birthday Cake. Firstly, this came out two years ago. I don't know why he's all going fucking crazy over it now. It's been out for ages in bar form. It is the first time it's been in a block though. Now the block is obviously trying to simulate this birthday cake. So it's got marshmallows, hundreds and thousands and biscuit pieces. What the Cadbury marketing team got wrong though is that this is a birthday cake in Australia. Not the fucking one in the last photo. That's in movies. This is real life. Or on really special occasions you've got a Freddo ice cream cake. I usually got these at like the Maccas. Remember the McDonald's parties? I loved them until someone shit down the slide when I was like seven and I remember sliding into their shit. So it's not a good memory. Let's do an unboxing. Oh, fuck me. Fair bit of shit. Looks like all the marshmallows have sunk to the, well actually risen to the top and then fucking all these on there. Quick cross section. Looks pretty good. Let's go. So it's good, but you could mix fucking anything into Cadbury and it would be good. Nice experience. You get the biscuit and the marshmallow and then little hundreds and thousands at the end, but it tastes nothing like a birthday cake. Nothing at all. Which pisses me off. Six and a half out of 10 for being a bit of a catfish. Just be honest.
