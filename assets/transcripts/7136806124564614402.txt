Righto, the Junk Food Graveyard Part 6, we're doing chocolates. Starting with the Wonka Mud Sludge, now this is a personal favourite of mine, it was like a normal Wonka bar but with a mud fudge interior, it was incredible. The closest we've come since was when they did the Chocolate Blocks and the Triple Chocolate Whipple had the same inside, it was pretty fucking good but not the same. Next we've got Cadbury Snaps, these were literally chocolate Pringles, they were fucking incredible. I know Aldi does something similar but these ones were Cadbury, therefore better. Then we've got the Polly Waffle, this was rumoured to be coming back a few years ago, I still haven't fucking seen it. Now I thought this was a bullshit story that my parents told me so I didn't eat as many chocolates but I just rang my mum to fucking double check and she still swears by it. Apparently my auntie found a cocoon, like a caterpillar cocoon, in her Polly Waffle like fucking 20-30 years ago and they sent her heaps of free shit. I thought it was a load of shit, just rang mum, she said it's not, whatever. Pink chocolate lovers will appreciate this, the White Night had the texture of a red skin wrapped in chocolate, I loved them. Now the Caramilk Flake is better but this is the OG, the Snowflake, it was a delicate little treat that turned the flake world on its head. Time Out has been killed but only as a brand because the Breakaway Twirl is the same thing, so if you love Time Outs and think they're gone, just fucking have one of these, same thing, just as good. Honourable mention to The Nut Break, I don't remember it but what a name.
