All right, Erin's Mum's Caramel Slice, another oak flavour, now have a look at this. The last two to three years of oaks, take a screenshot if you want to have a look at all the old flavours. These have all been pretty shit. Not one of these have I went and bought again. They all pretty much tasted like normal chocolate oak with a hint of something else. I don't have high expectations for this one. We're going to put Erin right behind me. I'm going to look her in the eyes, I'm going to try her Mum's flavour. By the way, really light, so it's actually not like a chocolate milk, it's more like a caramel. So, let's give it a go. Sweet. Give me a sec. So, it was just like a sweet caramel milk. Very boring. Was not caramel slice at all. Erin, your Mum's a shit cook. That was underwhelming. Four out of ten. Sorry, darling.
