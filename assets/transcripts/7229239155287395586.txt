Righto, the new street art range of Doritos, Kingpin Burger, Mayhem Kebabs, Fire and Fury Pizza. Now, I'm going to be honest with you, as you know I fucking love new shit, obviously, but Doritos are something that I never get too excited for. I reckon when Cool Ranch came to Australia, that's the last time that a new Doritos flavour has fucking blown my mind, I always go back to the originals. Now for this launch, it isn't the first time we've had a Kebab, Burger or Pizza flavoured Doritos. All of these were meh, in my opinion. Anyways, I'll stop whinging and give them another chance, I'm a big believer I think everyone deserves a second chance, not pedos, no, fucking get fucked, but the moral of this story is give most shit a second chance, so Kingpin Burger, let's do it. The packaging is amazing by the way, fair bit of flavour. Not bad, 6.5 out of 10, it's like a tangy special burger sauce up front and then real meaty just like a BBQ Dorito in the background, alright. Mayhem Kebab. I really don't know about them, you either love or hate them, they kind of taste like a Kebab smells, but they also taste like oriental Maggi noodle flavouring with a rosemary aftertaste, so if you think that sounds good, you might like them, I'm going to play it safe with a 5.5. Fire and Fury Pizza, they're shit, they literally taste like nothing and then they're hot, that's the only way I can describe them is nothing then hot, I'm going to give them a 4.5 out of 10, not like pizza at all.
