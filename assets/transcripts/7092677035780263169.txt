Alright, Doritos Flamin' Hot Cheese Supreme Flavoured Twisties. These are fucking stupid. They are the fourth iteration. You've had Flamin' Hot Cheetos plus original Doritos to get Flamin' Hot Doritos, Flamin' Hot Doritos plus Cheese Supreme Doritos to get Flamin' Hot Cheese Supreme Doritos, Flamin' Hot Cheese Supreme Doritos plus Twisties to get these. I'd also like to add, they've already done Flamin' Hot Twisties anyway, which were basically the same as your normal Flamin' Hot Cheetos. Eh, not what I expected. This has left me really fucking confused. It's like they think we're stupid and wouldn't notice that all three of these are the exact same fucking chip in a different packet. Four out of ten for trying to scam us, you dogs.
