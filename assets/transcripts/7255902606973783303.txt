Righto, the Sour Cola Billsons, they've got a big set of nuts on them doing anything cola. It's one of the hardest fizzy drink markets to break into. And that's because these two bastards have it covered. These are the best cola drinks on the market and everything else tastes like shit. In my opinion, any time I've had anything cola flavoured, it's tasted like fucking Australia's Choice or LA Ice cola. Or if they're real bad, they taste like black and gold cola. I still remember when I went to my mate's house and his mum said, and pulled me one of these. It was the first and only time that I've had the urge to headbutt someone's mother. And before he's called me rude saying maybe they were poor, that's why they could only have black and gold cola, they weren't. They were rich as fuck, they were just super scabby, and I hate them to this day. Anyways, this is sour cola, so I'm hoping it tastes like these, and that takes away from it not being like Coke or Pepsi. Anyways, let's get into it. Kinda smells like a Long Island iced tea. Okay, so it's accurate, but it's confusing. I don't know if I like or hate it, and I feel like it's gonna go either way for you guys. It's accurate. It's a sour cola, fair bit of tang, kind of a gummy flavour in the background, bit of a Long Island iced tea like I said before, but it does have a bit of a cheap cola aftertaste. Bit of that LA Ice that's hanging around there. I don't fucking know. I'm gonna give it a 6.5 out of 10, because I'm enjoying it as I'm having more, but I'm also super fucking confused.
