Righto, so it's the middle of winter but Red Bull are dropping a summer edition for some fucking reason. Apricot and strawberry flavour. Now I don't know who's choosing the flavours at Red Bull but these have all been fucking shit over the last few years. Coconut, pomegranate, fucking dragon fruit, who wants a dragon fruit energy drink? These have all been shit and now we've got apricot. Now whenever someone mentions apricot I always think of the orange one of these for some reason, that's all I think of. And just a quick fun fact, the orange Alan's snake is actually apricot flavoured, I only found that out a few days ago. Anyways, let's go. Oh, nah that's alright, that's actually, give us a sec, that's fucking mad, that's an 8 out of 10. It tastes heaps like the strawberry and lime Ricotta Lick Cider, I will buy this again but it's no Blue V.
