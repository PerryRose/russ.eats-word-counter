Righto, I finally found them, the collab of the year, KitKat and Milo, and fucking bargain, a dollar a chunky, a dollar for a little one, and then two bucks fifty for the fucking full block. Let's go. By the way, there's a reason I'm so keen for this. The original Milo bar is one of my favourite chocolates of all time. I'm not talking about these dry as fuck things you used to have at school either. I'm also not talking about the block, I'm talking this. This was the original Milo bar, chocolate, Milo in the middle, a fucking treat that went away and we all want it back. Quick dissection, gonna show you the guts as usual. There's a fair bit of Milo in that one, but I don't reckon there's, doesn't look like there's too much in the little ones, but let's go. Normal first, now the chunky. That's fucking incredible. I can't stop eating the bastard. I'm giving that an 8 out of 10, it tastes like a KitKat with Milo, but not enough Milo, but the chunky, fuck me, it's one of the best chocolates I've had in years, a massive throwback to when you used to eat a shitload of Milo, that's a 9.5 out of 10, incredible.
