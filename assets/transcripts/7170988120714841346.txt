Righto, now I forgot that Chupa Chups existed until I went to my first Bucks party and I know who's keeping you in business you filthy bastards, I don't want to talk about it so let's move on. Candy Cane Chupa Chup, a festive little flavour, I'm going to assume it's peppermint but let's get into it. Now while we're on the topic of candy canes, a quick shout out to the Jelly Belly Candy Cane, these were the ultimate candy cane growing up. There it is, it's pretty cute to be honest, let's go. I forgot how hard these are to unwrap but a candy cane's no easier so I can't complain. It's literally a peppermint Chupa Chup but I'm going to give it a 7 out of 10 for bringing me some good Christmas vibes, so if you like peppermint give it a try, just remember it goes in your mouth, in your fucking mouth.
