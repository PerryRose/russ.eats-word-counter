Righto, Great Northern has decided to enter the ginger beer market. Now when I first seen this I was just thinking, another beer company decided to go into ginger beer. Stay in your fucking lane, I was sick of it. But I've decided to review it for two reasons. One, I think we're due for a battle of the gingies, especially coming into summer. So comment below what you think the best ginger beer is and I'll consider it in a head-to-head battle. The other reason is just to talk about Great Northern in general. I cannot believe what this beer brand has done. Do you know how stubborn beer drinkers are? It's fucking impossible to get a fucking piss head off Three Cartons of New and onto Great Northern. I know so many people who have switched to this beer and you know that they're fucking making damage in the beer market when Twoies brings out a complete rip-off a few years later. Anyways, I'll shut up now, let's do it. Okay, that's actually pretty good. The way I'd describe it is it is the dead center in every category if you were to rank every ginger beer in the world. It's 4% in 1.2 standard drinks. It's not too sweet, not too spicy and not too gingery. It is dead center. I'm gonna give that 8 out of 10. I'm actually impressed. I thought that was gonna be fucking dog shit.
