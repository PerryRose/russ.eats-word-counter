Righto, the Monster Ultra Strawberry Dreams, there's been an early release at Ampile, and we need to talk about that by the way. I'm fucking confused with servers, and I'm not sure why we aren't talking about it. Every Caltex turned to an Ampile overnight, then every Puma turned back into a fucking Caltex, and then BP's turning into whatever the fuck Pearl Energy is. I don't know what's going on, it's some sort of service station swingers club. I'm confused. Is anyone else confused? Anyways, like I said, you get these from the new Caltex, which is the old Puma. Let's go. Fucking hell, they have done it again. Once again, no aftertaste. Like that Peach Ultra was absolutely magic, and this is the same. I reckon better. I'm giving that a 9 out of 10. It is a strawberry chup-a-chup energy drink that is absolutely fucking delightful.
