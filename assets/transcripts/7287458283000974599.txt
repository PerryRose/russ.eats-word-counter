Righto, two new Magnums. We've got the Sunlover and the Starchaser. I still view Magnums as a delicacy. Magnum egos I got like once in my childhood. My parents would never get them for me. They always made out they would go broke if they bought me a fucking Magnum. It's honestly the only thing I hold against my parents because I didn't get to have the 60s Nine range. Honestly, have a fucking look at them. Chalkwork Orange, Woodchalk, Peach Mango, John Lemon, Candy Warhol. I did have this. It was musk flavoured. Amazing. Jami Hendrix, Cinnamon on the Moon, Cherry Guerrera and Guava Lava. Fucking awesome and I only got to try one of the nine. Also, 60s Nine. Hilarious. You can't do that anymore. Kicking off with the Starchaser. It's popcorn flavour with a double dip of caramel and chocolate. Get absolutely fucked. I think that tops the Biscoff ice cream. That is a 10 out of 10. It is buttery. That fake butter flavour is awesome. Buttery, salty, creamy, chocolatey. Fucking incredible. Yeah. Let's do the Sunlover. So this is coconut flavour with a double dip of mango and white chocolate. A hard act to follow. Also, if you don't like sweet and salty and you don't like that fake butter flavour, you won't like that. Just a warning. Anyway, I am fucking speechless. Have a look at that. That is a 10 out of 10, but in a completely different category to this one. You're witnessing history. Two 10s in one video. To use it, say I don't give out 10s. Get fucked. What makes it is that this sauce is super sour, unlike any ice cream I've had. And it works so well with the creamy coconut ice cream and the sweet white chocolate. There is a fucking party happening in the freezer section. Wow.
