Right-o, snackology, the study of snacks. We're going fucking deep, we're going into the history of treats, starting with treats made from trash. Starting with Freddo Frog's worst enemy, the Birdie Beetle, an Australian showbag favourite. This was invented in 1963 from the leftover honeycomb crumbs of the fucking Violet Crumble. This blew my mind. Then we've got the Airheads Mystery Flavour. So kids always argued over what the fucking flavour was of the Mystery Flavour, and it all makes sense now. And that's because the Mystery Flavour is made from any combination of the flavours above me. It changes every time. The colour is added later in the Airheads process, so they get the leftover white shit, mix it together, and that was the Mystery Flavour. So it could have been half grape, cherry, a bit of everything, who fucking knows? It's the confectionary equivalent of my mum's savoury mints. She'd fucking throw anything in this. I swear, I swear I remember her putting leftover cut-up bits of Devon through the savoury mints, but love ya mum. I've got to mention Vegemite, an Australian favourite that is made from the leftovers of another Australian favourite. Vegemite is made from the leftover yeast from beer production, which makes me love it even more, to be honest. Now I'm just having a stab in the dark here, but I've got a gut feeling that the speckled fruit tingle is made of leftover fruit tingles. Can someone please confirm this? And if you've got any other waste product treats that you fucking know of, let me know in the comments. Cheers.
