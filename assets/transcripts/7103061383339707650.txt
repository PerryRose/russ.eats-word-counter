Righto, banana and caramel snack dairy milk. I'm a little bitch for banana flavoured treats. I love everything banana flavour, except these. These are fucking shit. These are one of the shittest lollies on the planet. They should discontinue them, but these. These are the banana snacks that I fucking love. The faker the flavour, the better. And just for your info, Perky Nana, these are my all time favourites. I know they sound like a nana with a boob job, but these are, these chewy taste, these are fucking awesome. If you haven't had one, give these a go. I'm going to have to do an unboxing. Oh, he just moved houses too, and we don't have a knife, so I've got this Stanley, so. Oh, check that out. That's smooth. Straight up his gut. See where the banana's in. Banana? Caramel? Fuck yeah. Both at once. Just a banana. Together is like Caramello with a hint of banana. Fucking awesome. Eight out of ten. But I reckon the banana by itself is an eight and a half out of ten. It is tasty.
