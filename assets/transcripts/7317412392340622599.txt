Righto, I'm away camper, but snacks don't take a break. We've got the new Soft Solo, okay? Kids, you can drink this one. Lemon mango, zero sugar. I've had so many messages to try this. I don't love mango in like my breakfast juices, but I love Mango Tango from Boost, which reminds me, it was this time last year, Boost reached out to me to do a video, and then they fucking ghosted me. And now we've got the cost of living crisis. So if you're still spending $10 on a fucking juice during this cost of living crisis, you're a fucking dumb cunt, okay? The juices have to be the first to go. Let's do it. Okay, that's probably the best zero sugar drink I've ever had. You cannot taste the aftertaste at all. Classic Solo with like a hint of like mango nectar taste in the background. That's fucking mad. If it had nine out of 10, if it had piss and sugar in it, it would be a 10 out of 10. That's pretty good.
