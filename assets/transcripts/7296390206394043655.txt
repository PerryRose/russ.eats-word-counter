Right, I've got some breaking news. Maccas has fucked with an original again without even telling us they've done another sneaky. Before I deliver the bad news, good news is I do have a merch drop live right now, link in bio. Perfect secret Santa present if you've got a treat-loving family member. Okay, back to what you're here for. A while ago they changed Sprite for Sprite No Sugar without letting us know. They were just putting through Sprite when you ordered it as Sprite No Sugar. If you've been following me for a while, you'd know this whole debacle made the news and everything. It was fucked. In my opinion, it's just as bad as switching the cheeseburger patty for a Beyond Beef patty and not telling us. A fucking dog move. Now, what they've done this time is fucked with our orange juice. You mightn't care, but I don't drink Maccas coffee because it tastes like burnt pubes, so why get an orange juice with my breakfast? What they've done is changed it to orange fruit drink, which mightn't sound like much, but there's a very sneaky reason I think they've done this. Bend you fucking way. We'll start from the basics. Juice comes from a juicer. All the old-fashioned way. You get the fruit, you squeeze it, you get the juice out. Okay, that's juice. Fruit drink, on the other hand, this is the new one at Maccas behind me, is about 35% juice, and they make it cheap as fuck by stretching it out with sugar. And that's exactly what they've done here. Here's the old and the new ingredients to prove my point. So Maccas has kept the same price, but then introduced a cheaper alternative. In my opinion, it's probably worse than the Sprite No Sugar. They made out they were removing sugar for our health, but then they go and fucking add it when it suits them. This pisses me off. And the verdict, it tastes exactly like this. No tang, super sweet like a cordial, which isn't bad, it's the principle that they didn't tell us.
