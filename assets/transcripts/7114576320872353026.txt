Righto, so tomorrow, a little embarrassing, but I've got to have a camera in me bum. And I haven't eaten for 24 hours, I'm fucking starving, and apparently I've got to drink this stuff, which says for bowel cleansing in adults, so I've heard this is one of the most horrible tasting and horrible experiences of your adult life, so I thought I'd take this on a journey. So this is some Dharma initiative from Lost Lookin' Shit, apparently I can mix it with water or Coke Zero, so we're going to go a 50-50 mix. We've got to wait 8 minutes for it to dissolve, and apparently it's mango flavour, fuckin' oaf. I've got to drink it slowly over 30 minutes, so I'm going to do it in 4, 7 and a half minute bursts. Here's number 1. I already feel like Dumbledore in the Half-Blood Prince when he's forced to drink the shit. Not good. Time for Coke. That's worse, that's fuckin' way worse. With the water, it's a 1 out of 10. Really salty fake mango. With the Coke, it's like a dirty Barocca that someone's like fuckin' just tip-tips the salt in. That's a 0 out of 10. I might give you an update of how it went tomorrow.
