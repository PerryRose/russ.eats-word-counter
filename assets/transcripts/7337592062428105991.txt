Righto, two new Pringles flavours, and just like Oreo flavours, in Australia we get absolute shit. For example, have a look behind me. Some of these look shit, like your Colt and fucking Cola, but at least they're interesting. We've got a sweet mayo cheese, which sounds sus, sweet flavours, cinnamon and sugar, chocolate, pecan pie, incredible. They even have nightclub flavour. I assume the seasoning's 300 bucks a gram and it tastes like a dance floor fart, which does remind me. Ages ago, one of my mates, not me, threw a fart bomb onto the dance floor and it shut basically the whole nightclub down and they would've lost thousands of dollars, so yeah, don't recommend that, okay? I didn't do it, though. Now I've just realised mid-review, they've already done these flavours to fucking repackage. The Korean BBQ was already out as the mystery flavour, and Brazilian BBQ, but this is South American, but Brazil's in South America, so yeah, fucking repackage. Anyway, so we've come this far, I may as well review them. Korean BBQ. Yeah, exactly the same as it was before, like a sweet garlic soy. They're alright, 6 out of 10. I'm just pissed off they're the same. And the South American BBQ, 5 out of 10, exactly the same as the Brazilian one, like a saltier BBQ. I think Pringles has gotten a bit cocky. They got savoury treated the year last year, and did this 6 foot tube of fucking Pringles, then they kick 2024 off with a fucking remastered flavour. They're like the COD, the fucking Call of Duty of the snack world. You need to start putting some money into R&D and bringing out some unique flavours. Even the Occult one, I would've been happier with than fucking another remaster.
