Righto, it's that time of the year where the Christmas treats are coming in hot. Now, I was a bit confused. I swear these were Malteser last year, and I've just noticed they're Kit Kat. Now, this is a big deal because these Malteser bunnies and reindeers are in my top three choppies of all time. I fucking love them. It pisses me off that they're only out twice a year. So the Kit Kat one better at least be equivalent or better. So I'm gonna be a very harsh critic on this one. Here's the Santa. He's a bit cute, but I still don't fucking trust him, eh? And there's a look at the guts. It looks mad. Let's go. This is a hard one because it's good, but it's nowhere near as good as the Malteser one, which is a 10 out of 10, by the way. It's the exact same texture, except it's just got little bits of wafer through it, where the Malteser one has fucking like a creamy malt with little malt balls. It's fucking incredible. Does not compare at all. Seven and a half. Malteser one's a 10. Please bring the Malteser one back.
