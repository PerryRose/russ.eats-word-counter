Righto, a new challenger has appeared into the iced coffee aisle with Mean Bean and Mocha Loca Monster. Now I do think this is the first time that Java Monster has entered Australia, but it is fucking huge overseas, look how many flavours they've got. Now usually I wouldn't have even bothered with this, because canned iced coffee is just fucking weird, but since these come out, I don't mind them and I'm open to canned iced coffee now. Now the weird thing about this isn't that it's an energy drink trying to be a coffee, we've had that before with V. It's the fact that a Monster is only in the 300ml can, it just looks fucking weird. We'll kick it off with Mean Bean. The Mocha Loca. Firstly, I forgot to mention these were $5.65 each, which is absolutely fucked, but this is really hard to explain. It's similar to the Boss iced coffee, but for some reason I like them, but I fucking hate these. It reminds me of that someone's made you a Macona instant coffee out of UHT shelf-stable milk, then let it go cold, and the aftertaste is like this filthy fucking sweetener, sus aftertaste. I'm going to have to give these a 4 out of 10, but if you like Boss iced coffee, please try these and let me know, because yeah, there's something going on I reckon.
