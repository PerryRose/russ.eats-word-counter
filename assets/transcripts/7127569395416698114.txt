Right-o. The new Kettle Native range. So Kettle to me are like the Kanye of the chip world. Some fucking bangers back when you were younger like Honey Baked Ham, Chili, some absolute classics. But unless you're really into Kettle, you don't really give a fuck about the new shit because they've just gone a little bit weird. I seriously can't believe these are chip flavors. This one sounds like a scented candle flavor. Finger lime and Tasmanian pepper leaf. We've got Kakadu plum and Australian aged cheddar. And then we've got lemon myrtle and roast chicken. That's a Harry Potter character. That's on Triple J. Kakadu plums on Triple J. I fucking shit you not. Let's go from left to right. Lemon myrtle and roast chicken. 7 out of 10. They're actually quite pleasant. A nice fresh lemon up front and then you just get like a hint of chicken at the end. Kakadu plum and Australian aged cheddar. I'm not gonna rate these because I honestly don't know what I think. There's like a fruit flavor and then a typical vintage cheddar flavor. I don't know. Finger lime and pepper queef. They're identical to the Red Rock Deli pepper and lime chips. They're an 8 out of 10. So I'm gonna give these a 7 out of 10 because they're fucking copied.
