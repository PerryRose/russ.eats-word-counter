Righto, another Vegemite collaboration. Vegemite and cheese hot cross buns. Now I do not have high hopes for these for two reasons. One, they just sound fucked. And two, I'm sick of Bega whoring out the Vegemite name. Ever since they bought the brand back in 2017, they have slapped the name on fucking everything. They're doing what Disney did when they bought Star Wars. Just bringing out fucking piss-weak products and whoring out the name. And in my opinion, it's kind of devaluing the Vegemite brand. Now the reason I'm keen for this is we don't have a scum-of-the-earth equivalent of the Cheesemite scroll. On the left here, you've got your $4 each upper-class baker's delight rolls. And on the right here, you've got your fucking cheap-ass cheese and bacon rolls that are actually a delicacy. These got me through a fucking splendor in the grass. Just six of these, about two cans of V, and a chip on a stick. Now I've always said we need the Cheesemite equivalent, and maybe this is it. Here it is. It's kind of a Vegemite cross. Now it's soft buns infused with parmesan and Vegemite with cheese on top. And it says 20 seconds in the microwave and a bit of butter is the best way to go about it. I'll try both. First, we'll raw dog one straight from the pack. And a warm buttery one. Exactly what I expected. Just like the cheese and bacon rolls, but without the bacon, of course. And you're getting like a yeasty Vegemite taste. It's pretty fucking bland. It's like a real processed, typical bread roll taste. And it could definitely do with more cheese. I'm going to give it a 5.5 out of 10, but it's a definite 10 out of 10 if you're fucked up camping.
