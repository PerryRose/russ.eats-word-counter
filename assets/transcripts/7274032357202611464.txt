Righto, we're having a lemon party, the battle of the lemons. To qualify for this, you need to be 6% and low sugar. Also, I couldn't find any Aussie-owned local brands that fit this criteria, so all of these are owned by the big dogs behind me. We'll kick it off with 196. This is who started this whole chain reaction of the low sugar drinks, which I think is the future of piss. Also, I think it's the biggest selling pre-mixed drink in Australia at the moment. We're going to use that as a baseline, you know, classic lemon tastes almost like a lift, slight aftertaste, but not too bad. Surely you know what this tastes like. The Brookvale Lemon Squash. Okay, so that one tastes more like a pub squash, and I've said that that shits all over the Suntory in a video recently, but it's actually pretty similar. The aftertaste is actually a little worse with that one side by side. Surprising. Then we've got the Kirin Lemon. Apparently this outsells Suntory in Japan. This is the number one lemon drink, but I don't know why they didn't just import it a year and a half ago to kind of like combat the Suntory making all these sales. Fucked if I know, anyway. Okay, that is a bit different. It tastes a lot more real, like real lemon juice, and a bit more bitter, but it's not bad. Now I've got the new Smirnoff. By the way, this has 20 times more sugar than the others, but 10 times less than a Solo, and it's a yuzu, not a lemon, but I'm putting it in anyway. Okay, that's completely different than the others. A yuzu isn't a lemon, so that's now disqualified, okay? It's a different drink. Not bad though. Okay, price doesn't matter. They're pretty much the same. This one has the best aftertaste. This one has the best upfront taste, but this one tastes the most real and I could drink the most of it. To be honest, just get whatever's on fucking special.
