Righto, Marvelous Creations Caramilk Jelly Popping Candy Beanies, I'm fucking very keen on this. The original back in 2012 tipped the fucking chocolate world on its head, there was nothing like it. Crunchy Smarties, chewy jellies and popping candy, it was multi, it was like, it was a multi-dimensional experience. And then Cadbury tips the chocolate world on its head again when it brought out Caramilk. There's fucking caramelised white chocolate shit everywhere, it is huge and I believe it's here to stay and will kill white chocolate. These flavours by the way have been fucking awesome. And then here we have the two biggest chocolate releases in the last ten years in the one block. I haven't been this excited since the Soundwave 2013 line-up. Let's rip into it, eh? Oh, fucking hell. There's a fair bit of shit in that, that looks gorgeous, look at that, oh it smells gorgeous, fuck me. Also, look, one serve equals two pieces, yeah right. Let's do it. That's fucked up, I'm speechless, that is that fucking good, it's still popping in my mouth, I'm fucking dribbling. Get ten out of ten, the two biggest blocks combined, it has to be a fucking ten, it's that good. Get in your car, if you don't get a block of this you're a fucking idiot, or you're lactose intolerant, but it is worth shitting your pants over, even if you're lactose intolerant, fucking give it a go.
