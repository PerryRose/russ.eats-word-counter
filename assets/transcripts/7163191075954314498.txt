Righto, the new oat milk plant-based Whittakers and a cheeky little comparison to the creamy milk. Slightly different cocoa percentages, but it's close enough. Firstly, a quick shout-out to Whittakers. They're a New Zealand delicacy. I fucking loved them ever since you could just get the slabs. Now we're seeing the blocks everywhere. They've even got a fucking Nutella-filled one coming out to Australia that's so popular in New Zealand, they can't even keep up. Quick unboxing, mainly because these are fucking massive blocks and opening one of these makes you feel exactly like Charlie from Willy Wonka. Like Charlie in the factory, not Paul with a cockhead grandad. Anyway, look at this shit. Oh, it looks alright. Here they are side by side. You can already tell that that 11% extra cocoa has made that so dark. This is not going to be a fair comparison. Starting with the oat milk. So the texture is bang on. It actually melts in your mouth and stuff like proper chocolate. Overall, it's pretty fucking good, except a slight suss oat aftertaste. Not full Uncle Toby, but a little bit suss. Anyway, let's try the other. Creamy milk. I should have compared it to Old Gold. It's closer to that than it is a milk chocolate. That's way too sweet to compare, so it's unfair. So if you're lactose intolerant, vegan, or your partner's vegan, so you've got to fucking eat vegan shit too. Not a bad alternative. Six and a half out of ten, just because the aftertaste is a little bit suss like your Uncle Toby.
