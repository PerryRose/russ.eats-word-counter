Righto, we've got original Monster Zero Sugar, about fucking time. I always found it weird Monster never did a Zero Sugar OG, when all the ones behind me, they were the first Zero Sugar flavours they did. And personally, I don't really like any of these, I think all of their other Zero Sugar flavours shit all over their original fucking Zeros. Also, why does Red Bull have two? Can someone explain the difference between them? Because I'm a bit confused. Okay, I haven't had a full Sugar OG Monster in fucking like 10 years, so I'm gonna have it. I also forgot what colour it was. I thought it was blue. Did it used to be blue, or I'm just a fucking idiot? Anyway. Okay, that's nostalgic. It's super, super sweet, almost bubblegum, but I don't mind it, but a lot of people fucking hate it. Anyway, let's do the Zero Sugar, see how it compares. Okay, they've done a fucking good job. That is identical. You can kind of taste the Zero Sugar, but I think that's because I just sipped the fucking full Sugar one. So if I bought that by itself, you probably couldn't tell, but I'm gonna give it a 7 out of 10, because that's what I think OG Monster is. So if you love OG Monster, but you don't have it because of all the sugar, this is all for you. But if you don't like OG Monster, do not fucking bother.
