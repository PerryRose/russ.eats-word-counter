Righto, Dan's Cherry on Choc. This is Aaron's mum's opponent in the oak flavour generator battle. Chocolate, cherry and coconut. It's just gonna be like a cherry ripe so let's give it a go. Okay here's Dan behind me. Loves cars apparently. Let's give his milk a go. Oh okay exactly like a cherry right? Lots of coconut and cherry. Dan you look like a bit of a sex offender but you do a good milk. I'm giving that I'm gonna give that a seven and a half out of ten. It's not exciting or innovative but they've done it well. They've done exactly what the thing says. Good work Dan.
