Righto, it exists. The Waffle-On Maxi-Bon is real. If you missed the drama a few months ago I'll give you a quick recap. So for a full month, April to May, Waffle-On Maxi-Bon stickers everywhere. Then, to my utter disappointment, they've slapped a Violet Crumble Gaytime sticker over the top and no one knows what happened. I heard a few rumours that something could have happened to the batch. Fuck knows. Worst part was Maxi-Bon declined that it existed in Australia even though I had evidence and also didn't care about my blue Waffle-On flavour idea. A quick reminder to buy your Bons in bulk. $15 for two boxes, that's $1.90 a Bon. If you're paying $5.50 a Maxi-Bon at 7-Eleven, you're a fucking idiot. Let's try it. I've also noticed they've dogged a 60ml box. That's the equivalent of 15ml of Bon for the same price. Fucking scum move. Anyway, let's go. Straight down the guts. Cross-sectional shot. Fucking A. Looks pretty good. Let's try it. Let's go. End the biscuit. Or waffle. I'm not putting milk to waste. Yeah, that's mad. I'm giving that an 8 out of 10. It's like caramilk at the top and then literally just like waffles and ice cream at the bottom. It's fun, it's unique, it's innovative, and I'm keen to eat the following three. If my girlfriend doesn't eat them, she always fucking does.
