Righto, two new ones from Red Rock Deli. These were $14 for both packs, so if they're not good, I'll headbutt the fucking CEO. That is an absolute scam. I have high expectations. Start with Crispy Chicken with Garlic and Sweet Soy. Okay, hear me out. You know how Pokemon evolved? This is the evolution of Honey Soy Chicken. One of the best chips ever, but this takes it to another level. I'm fucking impressed. 9 out of 10. It's got the garlic and it's not as sweet. I'm... yeah. Yeah. We're off to a good start. Malaysian Beef Rangdang. Rangdang. Okay, they fucking nailed that. That is spot on. You get a lot of coriander, ginger and chili. It could do with more heat, but you can taste the chili. I'm impressed. I haven't tasted a chip like that. I'm giving that an 8 out of 10 purely because it needs a little more heat, but that... yeah.
