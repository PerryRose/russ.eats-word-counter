Righto, my first ever miniseries. Pause your fucking Netflix and come on a journey with me. The hunt for the most palatable fast food coffee, episode one, Macca's. We are on the quest to find the most palatable coffee at fast food joints. So we're going to hit up Macca's Guzman, Hungry Jack's, or Jack's Cafe. I don't know if there's any others. McDonald's is notorious for absolute dog shit coffee. Now, Macca's coffee was that shit that they retrained. The whole marketing campaign was, we know our coffee wasn't up to scratch, so we've retrained our baristas. I worked there at the time. One lady came for a fucking hour and taught you absolutely nothing. No, I'm optimistic. I've never, I've never fucking had a fast food coffee. Oh, you actually haven't? I've been told okay things. This is the most fucked Macca's of all. It's, so some statistics. This Macca's used to do more sales between midnight and 3am than any other. I've seen someone shit on the floor, millions of pounds. And the problem is, when you're too pissed, they say to you, hey mate, go across the road. They must have a deal with each other. Go across the road, have something to eat, and come back in an hour or so, and we might let you in. So they actually send the most fucked of fucked people over to Macca's. We're not here to hurt feelings, but we're here to give honest feedback. Is this where you order? Do you have to use the screens? It's too futuristic. Hi, how you going? Can we have, um, dine-in coffee? Is that allowed? Small, right, yeah. I do want a small piccolo. Bust me. I think that's the playland. It's a bit sus if we're going there. Someone's had sushi. We've got to, we've got to check the toilets. All right, one, two, one. I'm gonna go get them. I just want everyone to know I'm going into this with an open mind, that this coffee could be good. The toilets are locked, that's it. Why are the toilets locked? Because people shit on the floor. I said that earlier. You made these up. Yes, well, this is footage of about five years ago. The coffees I would make at Macca's. What? There's a reason that that's, there is a reason that's on my phone. 110. We're at 121, for fuck. You would think coming to Macca's for a coffee, like, they'd be quick. I get anxious asking for the key, because you know how many people have touched the key with gooey hands. If you decide you don't want anything, this is the worst. Macca's, because you can't turn back. It took fucking 20 minutes. They are under the pump, though. They're under the pump, fair. There's a McDelivery area now, and it's just, I don't know. I don't know. Remember, we aren't being rude to the people that made them. They're just like, it's McDonald's procedures. We're going off that. The service was good. Service was great. So lovely. You okay? I don't fucking know. So there's no foam on the piccolo at all. It looks very, very watery. Mine looks a bit like, like a bubble bath. Mine's not good, but it's not, it feels bad. How, how do people fucking drink it? I don't know. What? And they've just taken away the orange juice, which is the only other breakfast option. I'm sorry. I'm not drinking any more of that. You're not? No. That's fucking disgusting. You want to try mine from the other side? No. Yeah, okay. I'll do it just for the video. I thought it was going to get better. It actually somehow got worse. That tastes better because there's more milk. Yeah. And less coffee. I'm going to have to try. That is like milk. Fucking try that. Jesus, we need to get out of this place. We didn't want to be too rude and loud in there because the workers aren't doing anything wrong. They're doing really well. Just, they're working with what they've got. Mine's milk. And then I had a sip of the piccolo, burnt pubes. Top five worst fucking coffees I've had in my life. Like a piccolo should look like a mini latte. And that looks like, um, like a colonosomy bag. And we don't want to seem like snob. I'm okay to seem like a snob. You're a snob. I drink fucking bougie coffee most days. There's something seriously wrong. I would say the gold standard for the shittest coffee is Starbucks. Like you have that. It's like, you gag. Was Starbucks worse than that? Starbucks is worse. Okay. Starbucks is worse, but this is in that bracket. I know you've never had a Macca's coffee before. I've had some okay ones. I was hoping you'd get an okay one because I've, you know. As soon as I saw the sushi on the table, I knew we were in for a fucking treat. You're better off not meeting the blender, right? Sorry, I just. Whoops. Is that an accident? Oh, fuck. Oh, I just. It spilled the door. The wind.
