Righto, a debut of a new segment, Russ Eats Around The World, starting with Ireland. Now, most people know Ireland for all this behind me, others know Ireland for Bono and Conor McGregor. But, thanks to Taste Ireland, I'm about to give you a taste of Ireland, that was cool. Starting with Taito, these are the biggest chip brand in Ireland, their biggest flavour is cheese and onion, which they claim to have invented, apparently. 9 out of 10, I fucking love these, I've had them before, they're the best cheese and onion chip you'll ever try. Club Orange, now this is bigger than Fanta over there. That's fucking mad, it's like a Fanta with pulp, it has real bits in it. I'm giving that an 8.5 out of 10, better than Fanta. Prawn Cocktail Pringles, they love prawn cocktails up that way. 8 out of 10, they're like salt and vinegar meets tomato, and they're the OG Pringle recipe, they're mad. Shrimps and Bananas, you know what I think about bananas. And a little shrimpy. Sorry Ireland, they're shit, 4 out of 10, they're like a reject shop lolly. Cadbury, so Aussie Cadbury is a different recipe, apparently to stop it melting or something. OG. And the Tiffin flavour, which is with dried grapes and biscuits. Isn't a dried grape a fucking Sultana? The Tiffin's pretty shit, but the dairy milk's up there, it's better, it's one of the best choccies I've ever had. 9 out of 10. I've got too many treats, not enough time, so I'll let you know how the Swizzles range are in the comments. Overall, not bad Ireland, these are the standouts, the loser was the Delicately Perfumed Sweets, they were shit.
