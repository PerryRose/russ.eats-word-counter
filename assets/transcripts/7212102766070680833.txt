Right-o, Raspberry Coke Zero. Now if you're thinking raspberry and coke is a weird combo, you're obviously not from Newcastle. A bit of a history lesson, I'm from Newcastle and we're only really famous for four things. Beecher's, Silverchair, Daniel John's right here, Joey John's from the Knights, and the VCR, the Vodka Coke Raspberry. Let's get into it. Sexy looking bottle too, Knight. I like the new coke bottles. A lot of people hate them, I think they're fucking sexy. Okay, if you're not from Newey, you're going to think it's a 7.5 out of 10. It's like a normal Coke Zero with a melted Ras Raspberry Sunny Boy through it, which isn't too bad. But if you are from Newey, it's going to remind you of VCRs, which is going to remind you of Uni Night, or either Fenny's or Argyle on a Wednesday, depending on how old you are. Which is going to remind you of Dancefloor Farts, BO, waiting three hours for a fucking train, kebab spews, and for that reason, I'm not going to drink another fucking drop.
