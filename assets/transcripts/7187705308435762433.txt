Righto, Vegemite Pizza Pockets. Now I nearly called this a pussy pocket when I rang IGA earlier and it got me thinking like if there was a food it probably it probably would be this. Now they've also brought out Vegemite Little Pizzas but I won't be reviewing these because Domino's already did it and it was all right but it was just Vegemite cheese and bread I'm not paying fucking eight bucks for that when I've just got it in the cupboard. Now before we start both of these releases did flash me back to the old lunch order paper bag days so it's inspired me I'm gonna have to do an episode on the ultimate lunch order in a couple of fucking days. Now for science I did different cooking methods two in the oven and they look fucking burnt I only did 20 minutes when it said 25 then I did 20 minutes in the air fry which is fucking rock solid then I did the microwave one but a cheeky little one minute in the air fry after and that one looks like the way to go. Let's do it start with the stock standard oven. Oh fuck me. I left that for 10 minutes and it was still fucking lava so that's just a warning don't stick anything in there without leaving it for at least half an hour that's shit that's just like a dry burnt bready thing let's do the microwave one. I can already tell this will be better it's the normal pizza rounder texture do not oven bake. Now for whatever you plan to do with this thing I assure you microwave is the way to go and have a look nothing like the fucking box it's showing like a black Vegemite filling it is nothing like that it's just a normal pizza rounder which is mad because I've missed him but it's a fucking scam whoring out the Vegemite name once again four out of ten dogs.
