Right I have some breaking news some sad news Maccas has done the dirty apparently and switched normal full sugar sprite for sprite zero sugar Makes no sense to me, but let's find out if it's true Um, could I get a medium sprite? Nice sugary sprite? That's all. Do you have normal sprite? That just says sprite zero on the screen Will you be bringing the normal sprite back? Sorry? Will you bring back? He's just run out of normal sprite? Um, no, we're not bringing it back to find out. Oh, okay, I'll try the no sugar one. Sorry? I'll have the no sugar one. Oh, no worries. All good. What's on everything? Um, that's all. A chicken and cheese with bacon. And a chicken and cheese with bacon. Steamed bun. Steamed bun. No worries. What's on everything? No, that's all. Thank you. Oh, you forgot the straw. Can I have the straw? Sorry. That's alright. Thank you. Every fucking time. I had to drink this with the fucking lid off the other day. First the no straw. Look at this. Add bacon. Just about to hook into it on the fucking drive home. Look at that. Where's the fucking bacon? Put a little cum shot. A little cum shot of mayo. Cheese smeared on the edge. No fucking... Man. Why do I keep going back here? No sugar. No straw. No bacon. What a fucking experience that was. We've confirmed the rumour's true. We've also confirmed Macca's still can't fucking get it right.
