Righto, cheesy enchilada. One of two in the New Mexican street food range. Now I've already cracked the packet and it smells exactly like Mexicana so I'm gonna get straight into it. Look it's good, but it is Mexicana. There is no fucking difference. I keep doing this, they think we're stupid. They think they can just put another fucking packet. Another packaging. I'm giving that a 5 out of 10 because it's another scam. These cunts, they make enough money, come up with something new. Fuck's sake, I'm sick of it.
