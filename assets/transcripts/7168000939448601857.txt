Righto, the Junk Food Graveyard Part 10, we're doing bickies. Now, I'm super passionate about this because I worked for three years as a chemical engineer in Arnott's R&D, so I was literally a biscuit engineer, so I fucking know me way around a bickie. And I took full advantage of this, I gained 25 kilos in the three years I was there on pure fucking Tim Tams, I shit you not. And if you missed it, I was called in as a biscuit expert on Sunrise a few weeks ago. On here we broke the news about the classic assorted getting the cut, but did you know in recent times they've gotten rid of the Dark Choc Royals, Lattice, and the Honey Jumbles? What the fuck's going on? Starting with the Quattro, these were a naughty little treat. They were chocolate biscuits with nuts and caramel, simple, effective. Now I could do a full episode on Tim Tams, but the Pink Wish is what I miss the most, the chewy strawberry center, and it was for a good cause. Then we've got the Pigs in Mud, I get this sent to me all the time, I never tried them, but I trust you guys, so I'll just take your word on it that they were a treat. Now this one pisses me off, you'd think Taste.com would fucking know their shit a bit more, but they talk about the OG Iced Vovo having marshmallow on it. Iced Vovo never had marshmallow, these were strawberry mallows made by Paradise, and you're probably gonna be pissed off at me for saying this, but I reckon these were better. I'll throw a couple in for you oldies, apparently the Honey Snap was a treat, it looks boring as fuck to me, but sometimes simple is best. The Bush Biscuit, this looks like the blokiest biscuit I've ever seen, this doesn't appeal to me, but I think for older people, I know they don't mind a bit of bush. Last but not least, Mint Slice used to have a couple of friends, the Mandarin Slice, but also Cherry and Coconut.
