Righto, another Caramilk classic, we've got Caramilk Breakaway. Similar to a Kit Kat Breakaway, except it's actually got like some soft chocolate at the top. Kit Kat Gold was fucking awesome, so I'm very keen to try this. I'm actually gonna do a little unboxing for this one because it's such a delicate little treat, so let's go. I actually noticed they've kept this as 180 grams, so they've made it super thick. Look how delicate that is, that's fucking, oh. So yeah, big bits, if you haven't noticed what Breakaway's like. I'm gonna cut this straight. Sorry, I was running out of time. There you go, that's what the middle looks like, heaps of chalk. Look at that, that's fucking thick. I'm genuinely excited for this, here we go. That is a little treat, that's a naughty little fucking magic. Oh, that's a nine and a half out of ten, that's nearly perfect. So light, melts in your mouth, little fuck, yeah.
