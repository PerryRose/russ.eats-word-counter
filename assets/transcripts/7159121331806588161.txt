Righto, the Twister's back. Fucking huge news, only on the secret menu. Now to get to the secret menu, you pull down like this and you hold it for about fucking five to ten seconds and then that appears, you click some buttons and that's how you get into it. Heaps annoying, you can't add it to a box or to a combo, so it's fucking eight bucks for the bastard by itself so it better be good, but it's back up, got a little cheeky three-piece box, just in case. Let's go. This line is fucked, look the speaker box is all the way over there there's fucking eleven cars in front of me, and I can't even go inside because I didn't wear undies or shoes. How's it going today? Hey, um, I've actually ordered on the secret menu, it's not too early for that is it? I've got the order number, it's um... Yeah, what was the number for that one? Hash... one thousand two hundred and thirty-seven. For Russell? Yeah, that's me. I've just got the um... Online order? The secret one. Secret menu? Secret... Thank you. And... And shit. Here's the guts, it looks alright, but there's just like one slice of that plastic cheese which is a bit sus, I was hoping it was that cheese sauce, but anyway, let's go. Cheers. That'll do hey, it must be alright because I've nearly finished it. And probably not worth eight bucks, but then again at a cafe a wrap's like fucking fifteen dollars these days. Seven and a half out of ten, way better than the crunch and a step forwards to getting twisters back.
