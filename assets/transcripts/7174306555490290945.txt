Righto, Chicken Parmy Flavoured Smiths Chips. I'm not going to get in the argument about Parmy vs Parma because they're both wrong. It's a Chicken Parmigiana and in Newcastle we just shorten it down to Gina. So anyway, let's give these a go. They're actually quite red. They don't really smell like Gina but let's give one a go. So they are quite pleasant to eat and they're better than the other launches but they're nothing spectacular and I wouldn't say that they taste like Gina. You're getting like a real heavy tomato paste and herb flavour and then kind of like a batter, like a snitty batter flavour at the end. No cheese, no chicken. Six and a half out of ten.
