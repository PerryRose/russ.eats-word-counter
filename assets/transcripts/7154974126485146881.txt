Righto, the comeback of the slab from KFC. I've wanted to review this for a while, but for an accurate KFC review, you've got to be in the mood for something fucking filth, and I am right now. It's a Sunday Arvo, what better timing? Let's go. Hey, can I get one of them filthy slabs in a combo for one? No problem, is that a large or a regular one? Got a large. Here we go. My weapon of choice was the original Pepsi to wash down this filthy beast, and it stitched me up on the chips, look at that. I didn't even nibble at any in the car, and that's what they gave me, that's fucked. Fair bit of weight to it. Let's open it up. It is literally the dinner rolls, which are mad, with popcorn chicken, barbecue sauce, and by the look of it, some cheese down the bottom, bit of a zoom in there. There you go, let's eat it. Firstly, the consistency across the dinner rolls is fucking piss weak. That's my quarter one. Look, one piece of popcorn chicken and a little smear of cheese. Anyway, I got one of the middle ones to really get this going. Let's go. Fuck, I'm filthy. So you can enjoy a time lapse of me smashing the full slab. I couldn't wait for it to end, to be honest, and don't get a large meal. I didn't even touch the fucking chips. I am full. Too much bread. The first one was awesome that was loaded. I was like, yeah, this is pretty good, like eight out of 10, but towards the end, the whole box, I have to give a five and a half out of 10. A Zinger stacker absolutely shits on this.
