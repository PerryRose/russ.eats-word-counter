Righto, we're about to rank shapes from first to last. This will be my personal ranking, so if you want to have a go at me, that's fucking fine. Or you can vote in my Instagram story and I'll be doing a people's choice ranking straight after this. Bottom of the barrel, we've got cheddar and savory. If you eat these without dip, you're fucked in the head. These are probably the most bland biscuit I've ever had. Next cheese and bacon. I just think the pink bits are fucking a bit weird. It's all right. I've got barbecue at fifth. I just think it tastes nothing like barbecue flavor. It's just a salty. It's just salty. Fourth, I've got chicken crimpy. I just think they're a bit dry. I think the mini chicken crimpies were way better than the big fuckers. Third place, we've got pizza. The shit at the bottom is incredible. They're nostalgic. They're tasty. They're fucking brilliant. Silver medal, go on a veggie like these. Shapes like Australia. Australian iconic flavor. You can't really get more patriotic than this. Again, they're fucking awesome. I know I'm going to cop a lot of hate for this, but my number one goes to nacho cheese. These are the only flavor to remain from the Shapes New and Improved disaster. All the rest of them went back to the original flavors except this. I'll have one of these. I'll always smash the whole box with some creamy bacon Zeus dip. They're fucking incredible. Either have a go at me in the comments if you disagree or jump on my Instagram and I'm holding a poll for the people's choice, as I said before.
