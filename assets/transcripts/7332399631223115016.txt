Righto, episode 6 of the Bun Hunt, we've got the Sticky Date Hot Cross Bun from Baker's Delight. Now, I'm gonna be a harsh critic on this one, because I fucking love a Sticky Date Pudding. One of the naughtiest desserts you can have, especially this. And don't even get me started on the Sticky Date Pudd Ice Cream. Fuck me. Let's have a look up close. I'm gonna be a bit more harsh, because they're $1.90 each, so a little bit more than the fucking other coals and woolly scumbag shit I've been trying. Let's do it. Also, Baker's Delight bread was a sign of wealth. If you went to your friend's house and they had that, you knew they had money. Let's raw dog it first with a fucking plain one. Cold with butter, and hot with butter. Okay, I had to go check there was actually dates in that. I swear she grabbed the wrong ones. That is a fucking normal Hot Cross Bun in every day of the week, okay? You can hardly taste the dates, but the worst thing is, where's the sticky part? Where's the fucking toffee and all that shit that there should be? I'm pissed off. That was a fucking $1.90 each. That was like $6 on buns. I'm giving them a 3 out of 10. It's a fucking scam. The bun's nice, okay? It's nice for a plain Hot Cross Bun, but that's not what I fucking signed up for.
