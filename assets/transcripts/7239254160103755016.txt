Righto, it's Origin, so we're doing some Wednesday piss. These are fucked. Three and a half standard drinks a can at 12.5% for $23 a four pack. That is $1.64 per standard drink. Put it in perspective, when you go out and get like a vodka raspberry, that's one standard drink for like fucking 12 bucks. $1.64. Fucked. These are in the same range as these that went viral a few days ago. I had no idea there was two other flavors. These have sold out everywhere, but these ones haven't. Yet. Now all that hot means absolutely nothing if they taste like shit. There are plenty of products on the market that'll get you fucked up, but they taste like shit. Good. Fat lamb. There's shit in your garden shed you can mix with a bit of orange juice that'll get you absolutely blind. The hint, the key is are these good? Let's kick it off with the mango margarita. Okay, so it tastes like a margarita you get at a shitty Mexican restaurant. It's not carbonated, which put me off because it was a can, and it's a lot better over ice. They're actually trying to be an actual cocktail, not just like a pre-mixed drink. I'm surprised. It's not as bad as I thought. Splitting a can with a mate over ice, maybe I would do, but other than that, I couldn't finish a whole can. I'm going to give that a six and a half. Not that bad. I think that's how you say it. Teenagers are spoiled with the shit they've got at the price these days. Seven out of 10, a little bit better, but they both taste cheap.
