Righto, the Chunk Food Graveyard part 11. I'm absolutely cooked with COVID for the second time and I've been on an absolute journey down memory lane just flashing back on the shit that you'd load up on when you stayed home from school sick. A big thanks for everyone who voted on my best sore throat relief Instagram poll. We had the Clippo win, it just edged out the Peter Jackson hybrid ciggies. But it was an absolute thrashing in pool 2 with the Pink Dilly taking out 74% of the votes. Cheers. Starting with throaties, now a lot of people thought these were shit, but they're unique. There was something about them, I reckon. Then we've got this bulk 30 pack of Ice Blocks from Home Ice Cream. These probably still exist, but I haven't heard this fucker ding his bell around my hometown in years. These were elite. Something satisfying about biting off the ice around the outside. Incredible. Then we've got the Soothers Smoothers. Now these were a scam. They didn't do shit for your throat. They were just a lolly disguised as a lozenge, but holy fuck, they were one of the best hard candies I've ever had. Then we've got the Toucan, one of my favorites of all time. But fuck, I hated the arguments when someone got a bigger half in your family, but these were mad. Then we've got Airwaves Gum. This gum cleared nearly every hole in your body. It was fucking powerful shit. Then we've got the OJ Ice Block. I don't remember this being a Clippo brand, but anyway, these were a tangy little treat. Now, I couldn't find any photos of these. I'm starting to question if they were real. Does anyone remember the Rugrats Ice Blocks? They were like a clear colorless Super Duper with all the flavors as the characters. And the Solo Ice Block. If you have a photo, please send it to me.
