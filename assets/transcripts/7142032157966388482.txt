Righto, the Junk Food Graveyard Part 7, we're doing mackets. Now I did 7 years in McCafe at East Maitland, so I'm super passionate about this. Here's me in 2012, 13, 14 and then 2018 at Splendour in the Grass for some reason. Anyways, here for the food, not my fucking life story. Starting with Pasta Zoo, little raviolis that came in Happy Meals with tongs and a dipping sauce. I found out these had a cult following when I talked shit about the Shrek pasta. I hated them, but you guys seemed to love them. Surely we can agree that the sipper straws sucked, they were such a disappointment. In 2 sucks they ran out of flavour and you're stuck with plain milk for the rest of your Happy Meal. The McRib, now I vividly remember being so fucking excited for these because of Homer Simpson's addiction that I had 3 on my break and then spent the rest of my shift in fucking pure agony. This was launched a few times, but I tried mine in the Flavours of the Games 2012 launch. Here's some of the others. The Bubblegum McFlurry, now this is controversial. This was released with these other flavours and they removed Oreo and M&M and everyone fucking blew up. Plus, on the initial launch, the marshmallows were hard, which was way better. And of course, just like Arnott's with the shapes, Mac has backtracked and bought back Oreo and then M&M shortly after. Speaking of McFlurries, the Nerds McFlurry, this has unlocked a core memory, I forgot all about this. The Gourmet Breakfast Bagels, the Boston Deli and the New York Benedict Bagel, these were fucking awesome. Do not say the McFeast because you can add tomato, lettuce and mayo to a quarter pounder at any time and it's the same fucking thing.
