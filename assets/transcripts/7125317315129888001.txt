Righto, Pepsi Max Lemon. So I promise this isn't an ad. I already own this hat. I just thought I had to wear it for this video. So don't think I'm getting paid off by the big dogs. I'm not. Anyways, in Australia they seem to bring out more Pepsi Max flavours than Pepsi. We've had Mango, Creaming Soda, Vanilla, Raspberry. I didn't mind them. Which sucks because I love the full sugar shit and overseas they have heaps of flavours. Including an IHOP Maple Syrup Pepsi. Which I tried to buy but it was $50 a can. They've done Marshmallow Peeps flavours. Even a Cracker Jack flavour. Just way cooler shit overseas. We get lemon. Lemon. Let's give it a go. That's boring as fuck. You get a hint of lemon at the end and it really amplifies the fake sugar taste. Which Pepsi Max usually doesn't have. So, 4 out of 10. That's shit.
