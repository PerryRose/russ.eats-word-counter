Righto, the new Macca's Summer Launch. I already did the Caramel Koki Poki last night, but we're about to try the two new birds and the Jalapeno Poppers. Let's go. Let's kick it off with the Cajun Chicken Deluxe. Let's see if it matches the photo. Kinda. Kinda if you squint. Now Macca's is that inconsistent. They have the highest standard deviation with the same product than any other brand out there. That is a good fresh one. So I'm going to give that an 8 out of 10. Just like a Chicken Deluxe, but with a Mac. That sauce is mad. That sauce is incredible. 8 out of 10, but it's probably a 5 if you get like a 2 AMer that sat there for a few hours. The Cheesy Jalapeno Pops, do they match the picture? They're way drier in person. These ones are a bit cold. I'll try them with and without the dipping sauce. 5 out of 10. The Aporto ones, absolutely shit on these. They kinda taste like something from the Coles freezer section that you've just air fried. Don't bother with them. Now the El Maco. So that is a catfish. That is completely different at the photo. My burger's frowning. That is actually a sad face. Anyway, let's go. This is like a McFeast meets Taco Night. Normal McFeast ingredients, but with a spicy salsa and a sour cream. And I reckon the sour cream is what makes this stand out among other Macca's launches. 8 out of 10.
