Righto, Chicago style deep dish pizza flavoured Pringles. I loved pizza Pringles growing up and they took them away and I've got myself a tube of the original American pizza Pringles, which these are still the original recipe, the American ones. Back in 2016, Pringles were a bunch of dog cunts and changed the Australian recipe, making them smaller and apparently crunchier or some shit. Here's a quick comparison of the American to the Australian ones. We've lost 6 mil in the tube and 15% in the Pringle itself. Worst part is the beautiful hyperbolic paraboloid that once was, is now a flat fucking duck beak looking piece of shit. But let's try them. And a US one. So the new Australian ones are fucking 10 times better than the American ones. I apologise for calling these dog cunts earlier for changing the recipe. It's actually way better. Here's a thin and stale tasting where these are an 8 out of 10 and what pizza Pringles tasted like in my memory.
