Right-o, dream raspberry bites. Little white chocolate bites with raspberry candy. Sounds fucking mad. Now, I am glad, because nearly every white chocolate combination they've just done with Keramilk lately, and I'm glad they stuck to the white choc with this. Because in my opinion, if it's raspberry, it's got to be white choc. Keramilk just won't work. Speaking of white choc raspberry, we've been treated to some absolute delights over the last couple of years. Didn't mind this block, loved these two. These were fucking incredible, and I will never go past a bag of white choc raspberry Daryl E. Bullets. They're the fucking best. Now, these were five bucks, and there's about fucking ten in the bag. That has got to be a piss take. I'm actually going to count them. Fourteen. Fourteen pissy little bites in the pack. They better be good. They got lucky. They are yum, and they're different to the other raspberry products that have like gummy shit through them. This is like small, hard, toffee-like pieces of raspberry, which I think works really well. So I'm going to give them a 7 out of 10. I wouldn't go sprinting to the shops for them until they're on special, unless you're like a massive raspberry white choc fan.
