Righto, the new cheesy range from Macca's. Just when you thought Macca's couldn't liquefy your ass anymore, they go and add a deep-fried cheese patty to the burger. Next, they're gonna add prune juice. I beg you, Ronnie Mac, please start adding some fiber to the menu. It's starting to actually have a toll on my physical health and my relationship. Kicking it off with the beef. Also, I'm recording from my car. Sorry if it sounds a bit weird. That was super fresh, so it's a good 7 out of 10, but I feel like that cheese patty will go fucking filthy if they let it sit for a while. Kind of just tastes like they've used the leftover mozzarella sticks and smashed them together in a patty. Not bad, though. The cheesy Angus. This is fucking huge, by the way. This is gonna make me so sick. 6 out of 10. There's a bit much going on, so you don't really taste the cheese. It's kind of... There's just too much going on there. And the cheesy chicken. I'm giving that the same as the beef. The cheese patty, when fresh, isn't fucking bad, to be honest, but the chili jam on all the burgers, I feel like a different source would have worked better. I don't know what, but overall, I'm alright about it. By the way, this was my setup just to show the dedication to you guys. Look at that. That's fucked.
