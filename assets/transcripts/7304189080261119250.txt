Right-o, Toblerone Praline. It's been a bit of a weak lineup this year for all the Christmas chocolates and festive piss. If there's something that I've missed, please comment below what I should try, because I'm struggling to find shit. Anyway, this review is important because they are twice as expensive as a normal Toblerone. They are $16 and you get half as much, which is a fucking absolute rot. So we're gonna check if they're actually twice as good. Also, I sat on the box. Fucking $16 and I threw this to it. Also, a year ago, I did the Ultimate Choccy Ranking, which I'm gonna pin to the top of my profile. There was some fucking controversy there. There it is in the packaging. Reminds me of the Malteser Truffles. Okay, these are 10 out of 10. Back before I did video reviews, they were fucking awesome. Oh, secondary packaging we've got there. Let's go. That's the guts. It's the truffle at the top and then the normal Toblerone shit down the bottom. They're fucking mad. I actually prefer this over a normal Toblerone. Same flavor, but a mad creamy texture, okay? It's fucking good. But it's a 9 out of 10 if someone buys them for you over Christmas, but only a 5 out of 10 if you're gonna fork out $16 for them. So that's the verdict.
