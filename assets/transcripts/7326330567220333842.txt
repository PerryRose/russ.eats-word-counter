Righto, bun two in the Rustor Eats to Bun Hunt. We've got the caramilk ones. These come out last year, and I've just noticed they're 24% caramilk. That's fucking chockers. Let's go. A plain one first. Cold with butter and hot with butter. Okay, by itself, boring as fuck, but with butter, both cold or hot, is incredible. The salty butter with the sweet caramilk works so well. I do prefer the hot one, though. There's something about the melting caramilk. I don't know, that's like a nine out of 10. That's one of the best hot cross buns I've ever had.
