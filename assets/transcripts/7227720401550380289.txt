Righto, musk flavoured Bilsons. I honestly think this is the first ever musk flavoured soft drink and I did make it to the Smashing Pumpkins just barely and there's one thing I've got to show you and that is this. Billy Corgan looks exactly like me when I dressed up as a giant baby back in 2016 at Splendour as if these aren't the same fucking thing. Anyway, let's get into it. The can is absolutely beautiful and that's the colour of it and I've just noticed there's a little bit nothing makes me more sick than like a little bit of food on a cup or a fork. I'm not drinking out of that. I'm going out of the can. Let's go. They've absolutely nailed that. It's heaps easy to drink. If you like musk, you will think this is a 9 out of 10. If you don't like musk, then why the fuck did you even watch this video?
