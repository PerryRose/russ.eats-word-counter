Righto. Caramel White Chalk Oak. There you go. I'm gonna review this in two stages. First impressions and then the proper review after I've had time to articulate my response because it's fucking hard to give a review on the spot when you've got like fucking 20 seconds. So let's see how it goes. First impression. Smells milky. Nah, that's piss weak. That's, it's gonna get a spray. Alright, next. Alright, that is a piss weak attempt at a caramel white chalk. It is about one molecule away from just being fucking sugar and milk. It's like vanilla malt without the malt and half the vanilla. That is fucking shit. That is a three out of ten. So, fuck you Oak. I'm glad you shut down in Exum, you cunt.
