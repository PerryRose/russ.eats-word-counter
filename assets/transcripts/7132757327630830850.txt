Righto, Meat Lovers Melts, if you've seen my earlier videos you'd know I'm not keen on these. The original I gave a 2 out of 10, I said they were like smegma on a chip and the cheeseburg was even worse. They were like dirt and smegma. They somehow captured the taste of 5 days no showering at Splendour in the Grass in a chip. Also just noticed that they follow me, so they're actually going to see this which is pretty funny. And Calvi Australia, they're who make the Harvest Snaps Pea Crisps. So I don't know how they went from vegetable pea shaped chips to cock cheese on a chip, but here we are. Let's do it. By the way, these are Meat Lovers chips. I can handle kinda wet cheese on a chip, but if there's meat on these, I'm not fucking doing it. Let's go. No meat. There's no meat on them. Let's have a look. So if you've seen the first time I had these, it was like wet cheese melted, like stuck, all the chips were clumped together. It looks nothing like that anymore. They smell a bit like dry dog food, but they don't look as fucked as the first lot I had. Let's do it. Oh, it's a tough one. I just don't know, like this pack doesn't have as much cheese, so they're edible. Like this is, the chip itself is a 6 out of 10, but when you get a lot of cheese, it fucking drops it back to a 2. Overall, 4 out of 10. Flavour's alright, chip's alright, cheese is fucked. Melts, I'll give this another chance, just stop putting as much fucking cheese on them.
