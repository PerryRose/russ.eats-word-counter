Righto, it's fucking custard season. I would do a hunt for the best custard, but I have so many hunts on, okay? Let's- we'll do that next year. Now, this Gaytime Custard is the third of the Paul's, like, sweet treat collabs. I reviewed these last year. If you missed it, I pinned it to the top of my profile to save you scrolling. That is thick as fuck, and it smells awesome. I've been warned this is one of the greatest custards of all time. My mate Beefy's gotten through about 10 litres, so I've got some high expectations. Let's go. Fucking hell, a dollop of that with a Christmas pud is going to be absolutely groundbreaking. It's only a subtle toffee. It's just like normal custard. Mad consistency with a hint of toffee that brings it up to a 9 out of 10, because custard's already a fucking treat. I will be polishing the rest of this off. I know what you're thinking. Russ, that much custard? You're gonna shit yourself? I don't fucking care. Bring it on.
