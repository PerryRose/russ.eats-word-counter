Righto, the Vanilla Malt Shaped Golden Gaytime. The Golden Gaytime was a simple ice cream for 59 years. Until we hit 2015 and they haven't fucking stopped. There's been 16 variations of the Golden Gaytime ice cream. Here they are in order. Strawberry, Mint, Chocolate, Unicorn, Pina Colada, Mi-Mi-Mint Face or some shit, Choc Fever, Salty Gaytime, that one was a bit sus, Violet Crumble, Krispy Kreme, Birthday Cake, Coco Pops, Crunchy Nut, Fruit Loops, the cereal range, Plant Based, that one was a bit sus, and now Vanilla Malt Shake. Anyways, I love the Vanilla Malt Oak, so I hope this is similar. Let's get into it. Let's do it. This looks like a normal Gaytime. That fucking works. It's like an enhanced Golden Gaytime. It just seems like a normal Gaytime, but then the aftertaste, the malty aftertaste hits. Very similar to that Oak Vanilla Malt flavor. I fucking rate this. I rate this a lot. Eight and a half out of ten.
