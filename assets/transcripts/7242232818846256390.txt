Righto, the Aldi exclusive Queen's Birthday British drop. Prawn cocktail, Worcestershire sauce and bangers and mash. Firstly, I've got to apologize I fucking, I'm Nostradamus. I predicted, I predicted the Queen's death. It was me. All this British shit I'm assuming it's for the Queen's birthday And I'm glad they're doing it because she's probably only got about one fucking birthday left in her. See, I was right I feel bad, but to be honest, same for the fucking King. Anyway, they had cheese and pickles last year They've replaced it with bangers and mash. Gonna start with that one, then we'll do the others again Okay, these actually taste like British food. Bland and dull as fuck. I'm giving them a four out of ten They taste like a weaker version of these chips. The prawn cocktail, last year they got eight and a half out of ten I thought they were gonna taste like prawns, like a fucking fanny, like a fanny chip But I was wrong. They tasted like a tomato, meat, salt and vinegar But this year I reckon they've got more of a mayo taste to them So I'm actually gonna drop them like a sour cream taste I'm gonna drop them to an eight out of ten. Not as good as I remembered last year. The Worcestershire sauce These are even better. Last year I gave them a seven out of ten Which really pissed my mates off who absolutely polished the rest of the pack off. These are one of the best chips I've ever had. They're like a salt and vinegar meets soy sauce, like super umami flavor. I can't even describe these I'm gonna upgrade these to a fucking nine out of ten. Like one of my favorite Smith chips ever
