Righto, the last of the Aldi exclusive British drop we have, I say Worcestershire sauce but I just googled how you actually say it and apparently it's Worcestershire, Worcestershire sauce. Who cares? Who fucking cares? So, they smell like sour barbeque chips, let's go. Oh, they're fucking tangy in that, they're tangier than the other two, give us a sec on these. So, I've eaten legit half the fucking pack to try and explain what these taste like. They make your mouth water heaps, which is weird and they're like really sour like salt and vinegar but I don't really fucking know. Worcestershire sauce is like a soy sauce that's sour and I guess that's what it is. Really odd. You'll have to try them for yourself. I'm going to give them a 7 out of 10 because I do want to keep eating them, which is a positive sign, but they're fucking odd.
