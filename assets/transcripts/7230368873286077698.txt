Righto, something a bit different. Warhead Pickle. I have tried the normal one before and it was a bit fucking much, but I love Warheads and I do love Pickles, so I'm going to give it a second chance. This cost me 850 tickets from TimeZone. Had a little play there yesterday. And by the way, I won a Care Bear, right? And I gave it to this little girl because her dad was shit at the skill test and I fucking nailed it first go and I just felt bad. Then Demi, my girlfriend, was pissed off at me because I didn't give her the Care Bear. So then I spent like 30 bucks trying to win another Care Bear and I lost and then she didn't have a Care Bear. I lost 30 bucks. It was just a pretty shit experience in the end. Besides this game, this was a whole lot. It was kind of like Guitar Hero for drums and I was fucking pumping on Expert straight up. I was even doing some one-handed death leopard shit at one stage. I was on fire. Let's do an unboxing for the full effect. That is fucking filthy. That is a hungover piss. And have a look at this absolute slug. That's a dildo. That is fucking massive. Here it is. Not a bad size. Slight curve. Nothing wrong with a bit of a curve. I'm not fucking keen on this. I'm going to get close up for this. Firstly, it's not actually that sour. It just tastes like the other pickle I've already had. And it's just an overdose. Even if you like pickle, this is too fucking... It's not even a pickle. It's a full kiwi. A full cucumber. If you enjoy these, you're a fucking sick bastard. It is too much. I'll stick to the little baby ones in a jar. Van Halten, you're a sick bastard. One out of ten.
