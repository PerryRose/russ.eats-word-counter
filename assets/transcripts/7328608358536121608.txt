Righto, Monsuta, 6% lemon, 7.3%, which I think's a bit much. Mango and pineapple, all are sugar-free too. Also, the reason I'm having a drink this early is it's hottest 100, which I used to love, but I'm getting old, I have no idea who anyone is. Who's Dom Dollar? I thought 50 Cent might have changed his name because of inflation, I have no fucking clue. So yeah, I need a drink, because this is the initiation into a middle-aged person, right? When you stop knowing Triple J artists, you're officially old. Anyway, I'm gonna go the strong one first, mango. Nah, you can got too much aftertaste in that. I think 6% is the limit for this type of fucking drink. I'm gonna give that one a four out of 10. Nice, fresh mango flavor, but it's getting murdered by the fucking piss. The pineapple, a bit better. I'm gonna give that a five out of 10. It's like a nice pineapple juice, fizzy flavor, but once again, a bit of that, I'm happy you get it. And the 6% lemon. Let's see how these go against the lemon party contestants. Yeah, that is proof that 6% is the limit. That's exactly the same as your Suntory's and that. So if it's cheaper, buy it, but if not, there's no real reason to. It's an already saturated market, but I guess it's six and a half out of 10, the same as those.
