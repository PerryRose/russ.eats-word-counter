Righto, the Allens Big Aussie Road Trip. So, I was reviewing these because I thought it was a great idea that they were doing a flavour lolly about all the tourist attractions around Australia. I was wrong. They're doing it on the areas that make the fruits, which is fucking boring. They've got Coffs Harbour, right, that has the big banana and also grows bananas. However, they've done Maryborough for the pineapple, instead of the big pineapple in Wombai two hours south. And Riverina, New South Wales, instead of the fucking big orange in South Australia. So they've got it all wrong. I'm kind of glad though because if they were doing big tourist attraction flavoured lollies I would have sent some hate mail for not including the big prawn. Aussie to Mozzie, or the giant Ugg boots in my home town. Actually, Allens lollies kind of taste a bit like Ugg boots. Anyways let's try them. We've got strawberry. 6 out of 10, it's alright, but it's no Starburst strawberry. Apple. 7.5 out of 10, that's pretty good. Similar to the Starburst apple actually. Orange. 6 out of 10, it's alright, but I'm getting like an orange peel taste, like a bitter taste which is pretty shit. The pineapple, which looks different to the normal Allens pineapples. I feel like that's different, a little bit more tang, I'm giving that an 8 out of 10, that's actually pretty good. And banana. 4 out of 10, a gummy banana shouldn't exist. 6.5 out of 10 overall, it's a fun idea, they could have executed it better, and the banana really brings the whole bag down.
