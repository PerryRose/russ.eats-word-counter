Righto, so first of all, I had to wear the shirt, it's not an ad, I won't sell out, I fucking promised. Second of all, this has been an absolute journey. Sprite Lemon, the Lyft replacement. So I announced this rumour a few weeks ago, must have been a slow news day because it ended up on Pedestrian TV, The Daily Mail, and Channel 9 Kitchen. Now what I didn't know is that Lyft died fucking ages ago, they took the sugar out and added sweeteners, and I could not believe how fucking shit this was until I did that taste test yesterday. I was just so confused, that's why I got it wrong. I'm not making excuses, but I was very confused because I didn't know it was that shit. Anyway, Sprite Lemon, so Solo has 69 grams of sugar in a 600ml, this has 39, and Lyft was down to 26. So it's also a lot clearer than the Solo and the Lyft, but let's go. I couldn't taste the sweetener yesterday, but I can now that I fucking know it's in there. A sip of Solo for contrast. So it's a massive step forward towards the Goat Solo. Solo's still like a 9.5 out of 10 soft drink, it's a fucking treat, a tangy little lemon treat. This is still pretty good. Yes, I can taste the sweetener now I know, but yesterday I couldn't tell the difference, so I'm not gonna lie to you's. Pretty fucking good, I'm gonna give it probably a 7 out of 10. Lyft, 2 out of 10. I'm tipping this down the fucking toilet.
