Righto, the new Birthday Cake Flavoured Latte and Ice Latte. There's also some new spicy shit, but I'm not mixing coffee with spice. Not this late. I respect my ass too much. Let's go. What flavour is that Birthday Cake Latte? Um, what flavour is the Birthday Cake Latte? Um, Birthday Cake? Well, that is the flavour. Yep. What's that? Um... Well, I'll get the Birthday Cake Latte, small. So, no one knows what it's actually supposed to taste like. She couldn't stop giggling. She had no fucking idea. I'm going to assume jam, cream, cake, you know, Birthday Cake. Anyway, the hot coffee first. Okay, they've jipped me on the syrup. There's either fuck all in there, it is slightly sweet, or they've completely forgotten it. It does taste like a Birthday Cake though, but more like a burnt fucking candle. I'm convinced they've forgotten the syrup in that, so I can't even fucking review it. That's piss. Okay, let's see if we can taste the flavour in the Ice Latte. Also, they advertise it in this beautiful clear cup, and it comes in this squash the fuck out of the cream and the sauce. Anyway... No. Okay, this is the first time in history that I cannot give a rating, and of course it's Macca's. Macca's, if you're watching this right now, I'm keeping both of these in the fridge so you can fucking test them. It's either the weakest syrup in history, there's fuck all syrup in it, or you've forgotten it altogether. Absolute fucking dog shit. One of the worst birthdays ever.
