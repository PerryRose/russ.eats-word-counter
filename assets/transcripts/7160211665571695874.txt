Righto, Violet Crumble and Strawberry Chupa Chup Flavoured Custard. Now flavoured custard is one of the fucking OGs from school back in the day. I'm not talking the yellow shit you have with a Christmas fruitcake, a little cheeky dollop. I'm talking this. Yogo and Snack Pack. You were an absolute lord if you ripped one of these out of your lunch box and it was always at recess, not lunch. Because these piss-weak ice packs would only ever keep the custard cold enough for recess, otherwise you're having a lukewarm one at lunch. You just, it was just a waste. It was a fucking waste. Anyway, starting with strawberry. Smells exactly like I remember them. Exactly like the Strawberry Yogo or Snack Pack. I'm gonna have to give that a 7 out of 10 because it's a mad flashback, but it's nothing like a fucking Chupa Chup at all. It's just Strawberry Yogo. Violet Crumble. This is a dark choc eh? Oh no. That's fucking phenomenal. It's also flashing me back to Chocolate Yogo, but it's got a Violet Crumble honeycomb which just makes it even fucking better. I'm gonna have to give that 8.5 out of 10. That is a fucking treat. I've nearly polished it off already.
