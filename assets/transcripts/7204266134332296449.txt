Righto, the Russ Eats Flavour adventure's about to commence. I've got a five hour trip ahead of me to Bilsons and I'm off to a bad start. Seriously, who invents this shit? I feel not well below the line and then coffee just pissed out everywhere when I put the lid on. Also, I've switched to a third person narration voice if you haven't noticed. Some quick housekeeping so I didn't come home until I kick up the arse. Said bye to my best mate because he gets anxiety and pisses blood every time I go away. Then this lady, I know it's her job, but she was fucking ruining holidays. Even 500 grams over and she was charging him 65 bucks. It was a stitch up. So, checked in with my watch like an absolute wanker and then I thought I'd mention I'd seen a giant Zinger box at the airport, which is pretty cool. Next we began the three hour trip from Melbourne to Beechworth and I forgot how many fuckwits are on the road in major cities. This bloke in front of me, he's lucky he was bigger than me because if he was small and weak I would have fucking got straight up his arse. Got there around 6pm and I pretty much just checked in, did the review, went straight to bed. Then I had a coffee in the morning at Project 49, sprayed the fuck out of the Brewer House bowl and then my walk begun to the factory. I decided to walk because I knew I was going to get absolutely fucking pissed. We started with the Winnie Blue flavour, which is probably one of the worst experiences of my life. Look at that nicotine extraction. This went straight in the bin and then we got into the good shit. We kicked it off with Cyclone, peach, pineapple and blueberry. Now we noticed that we were missing a crucial ingredient, which was apple juice. We also noticed there was wheat in the Cyclone, so Gus Siciliac was paying $1.10 for a shart by the end of the day. Now this was an absolute breakthrough. It was fucking incredible. We were off to a good start. Stay tuned for part 2 where I do the other flavours.
