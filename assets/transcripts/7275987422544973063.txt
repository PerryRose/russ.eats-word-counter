Right, I've finally got my hands on it, the new Rainbow Sherbet Mother. There's two things that piss me off about Mother. First reason is this Danzig song from Guitar Hero 2 gets stuck in my head every time I see the can. Second reason is I feel like their line-up is so much weaker these days than it was. Like, these were just top tier and I feel like none of these have even gotten close. Maybe La Baguava, but we'll see if I can be proven wrong. I will mention though, all of their releases have been better than this, the original, which was like body odour in a can. I don't know how they did it, but they got body odour in a fucking can. Let's do it. It's a light pink colour and the can looks like something off Pimp My Ride. Pimp My Ride, by the way, was probably the most dumb show I've ever fucking watched. They get someone's $200 Camry and put 10 TVs and a hot tub in it. I hated that show, but also I kind of liked it. Okay, it tastes nothing like this. There's nowhere near as much sherbet-y tang in the aftertaste, but I reckon it tastes exactly like these with a slight tang, which I like. So I'm going to give that a 9 out of 10. That is a fucking sweet, sweet treat.
