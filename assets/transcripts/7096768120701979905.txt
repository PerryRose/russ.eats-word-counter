Righto, Old Gold meets Mekona Instant Coffee, the collab that no one asked for, but if you drink an instant coffee, you're probably eating old gold, put it that way. The reason I won't knock the collab is because this is obviously a collab no one wanted back in 2013, but this song actually slapped and turned me into a dirty little boy on the schoolies dance floor. Anyways, Mekona's probably the best of the instant coffee world, but instant coffee's the fucking trash of the coffee world, so it's kind of like coming first in division 10, but let's try it. I don't know. So the initial bite was really bitter coffee, but then once the chocolate started to melt, it was actually pretty fucking good. I personally wouldn't buy it, but if you're into this, you will really like this. It's actually a decent coffee chocolate. I'm going to give it a seven out of 10 because I'm surprised.
