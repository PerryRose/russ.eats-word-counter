Righto, Tim Tams have went gluten-free. They're about half the size and double the price, and they are playing with fire here. These are protected under the Australian Constitution. If you fuck up the Tim Tam, you're in big trouble. Now what I mean is, they've done a heap of other gluten-free shit, but no one cared if they fucked them up, because they're not protected. The Tim Tam, the original Tim Tam, it's like doing a remake of The Castle, alright? You need to be very careful. I forgot to mention, I'm probably the most qualified person to do this. Not only am I an ex-biscuit engineer from at Arnott's, you all fucking know that now, but I was misdiagnosed as a celiac, and I lived on a gluten-free diet from the age of 12 to 14. So I've had some fucking gluten-free shit, don't you worry. Okay, so they pretty much look identical. I'm gonna do the gluten-free one first, and the OG. Okay, the flavour is bang on, but there is some slight textural differences. This one definitely has more cream in the centre, and the biscuit's a little bit gritty, but it's not as hard, where that one's a classic Timmy, I know a fucking Timmy. I'm giving it an 8 out of 10, they've had a red-hot crack. It's actually, for a gluten-free spin-off, not bad compared to some of the absolute shit I've had.
