Righto, crispy fried chicken with hot sauce red rock deli, so this is the third of the Colin Fastenage Chef series. If you missed the first two in the series, these were braised beef brisket, I gave them a 7 out of 10, and crispy pork belly, which I gave a 4 out of 10. So the range wasn't off to a roaring start, but we're going to see if he can redeem himself with the chicken. Let's go. They smell pretty good. I don't mind they're made, it's been a while since I've liked a new chip flavour, so I'm going to give them an 8 out of 10. It's a complex flavour to nail, but I reckon they've done it. You've got like crispy fried chicken batter up front, typical red rock deli chip flavour in the middle, and then like a frank's hot sauce at the end that actually builds in heat. I'm planning on getting the undies and fucking get on the lounge and polish the rest of these bastards off. So fucking, I can give them a shot.
