Righto, part four of the flavour journey and it's starting to get fucking real now. Firstly, July is apparently when this is coming out. Everyone keeps asking. Secondly, four prototypes right behind me that we're going to try. Let's fucking do this. I've got four different prototypes of the Cyclone flavour. Now the colour, as you can see, it's slightly different. But what I'm going for is the inside of a Cyclone. And I'm hoping the can will be red and green. And the inside, you know what I'm fucking going with? Anyway, let's do this. Let's taste them. Starting with A. Now they all smell exactly like a Cyclone. So I'm fucking keen on this. Let's see how far they've come since I went down there a few months ago. B, C and D. Okay, this is way too fucking hard. I had the most fizz, so I definitely like the fizz. But B and C's flavour was better. I need a second opinion. So I'm bringing this piss to the pub for the boys to give me a hand. What do you think? It's good, eh? It's very good. Moz with the fresh cart. Everyone's good. Did you just go meh? Hands up for A. Yeah. B. Dan, B? B? B was alright. B was second best. Alright. C? C was second best. D was too flat.
