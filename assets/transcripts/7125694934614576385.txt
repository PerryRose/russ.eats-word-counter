Righto, so I'm going to try something different today. I'm trying freeze dried treats. So I've been wanting to try these for fucking ages and thank you to the freeze queen for dropping some off yesterday. So believe it or not, I am actually a chemical engineer. I don't just review food. So this shit really interests me. Don't know if you care, but I'm going to explain it. So freeze drying, they reduce the temperature to below zero degrees. They then reduce the pressure down to near a vacuum. So the ice goes directly into a vapor through a process called sublimation. Doesn't have to melt into a liquid and then into a vapor. So that's why you can freeze dry a golden gay time and it can keep its shape. Let's try them. Check this out. We've got a freeze dried red skin. That's a dog's dick. That's a fucking dog's dick. Freeze dried sour Skittles. See they'll fully puff up. Check this out. We've got a pineapple lump. Break that up. So it's fully dried in the middle, but it keeps its shape. Here's a full fucking Cocoa Pop golden gay time. Let's give them a go. Starting with the red rocket. It's like honeycomb, like violet crumble. That's fucking weird. Oh yeah. It tastes exactly like a red skin, but it's violet crumble texture. Let's go another one. Gay time. Skittles. Lump. Honestly, like nothing I've ever tried before. You fucking got to give these a go. Honeycomb texture, but tastes the same as the original product. The Skittles are the best, easily.
