Righto, crunchy honeycomb M&Ms. They already did crispy honeycomb M&Ms which were literally honeycomb flavored crispy M&Ms and I gave them a 10 out of 10 so it's safe to say I'm pretty fucking excited to eat a few of these. I might even shelf one. Let's dissect one. It's just like a little crunchy, that's mad. Let's go. So like the size of a peanut M&M by the way. Interesting. So you get the initial crunch and taste of a crunchy but then once that dissolves it just tastes like a normal fucking M&M. Not enough honeycomb flavor. They're not a 10 out of 10 like the other ones. I'm only going to give these ones a 7 out of 10. They're alright.
