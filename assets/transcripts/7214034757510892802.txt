Right, he's known me well enough by now, it's a Friday which means I'm going to have a cheeky little bit of piss and today I've got the Sour Apple Vodka Cruiser. Now this is their third Sour release and all of them have been Liquorland or First Choice Liquor exclusive which annoys the fuck out of me because there's none nearby. Sour Grape didn't have enough tang, Sour Strawberry didn't have enough tang, let's see if they can redeem themselves with a little bit of tang in this one. Let's do it. I also love reading the pregnancy warning, alcohol can cause harm to your baby but babies cause us to drink so we're kind of fucking even if you ask me. Cheers. For full effect I've got a Vortex on, I forgot about the Vortex. Oh that's fucked up. That's spot on, that's some of the best apple flavoured piss I've had, it is exactly what you want a Sour Apple drink to taste like, 8.5 out of 10, it's gorgeous so if you love Sour Apple lollies you'll fucking love this.
