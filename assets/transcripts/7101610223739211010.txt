Righto, The Junk Food Graveyard Part 2, we're gonna continue on with school shit. Starting with Dunkaroos, now I had the choc hazelnut ones last year, apparently they still exist. It's the strawberry ones I want to pay my respects to, they were way fucking better. In my opinion though, tiny teddy dippers were way better because you could take out all your anger on these little bastards by snapping their arms and legs off one by one. Also found this photo where some sick twisted kid's about to reenact Jumanji and torture this teddy in quicksand. Next we've got roll-ups, but not any roll-ups, sour roll-ups and ones with like Rugrats and Bugs Life printed on them. Now these were a winter snack because if your mum fucked up and put one of these in your lunchbox in summer, you'd spend half your recess trying to peel the bastard from the plastic. I'll also need to mention the metre long roll-up, the Uncle Toby's Fruity Meter. I was only lucky enough to eat one of these in my childhood, they were the elite roll-up. Honourable mention to these weird fruit sticks, they still exist but if they're not Bilo brand or no frills, I don't want to know about them.
