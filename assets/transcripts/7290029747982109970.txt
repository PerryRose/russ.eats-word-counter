Righto, lychee vodka cruiser. Simple, but I'm fucking excited for this. A lychee martini is one of my favourite drinks. And I had a few cans of this a while ago, one of the best drinks that I've ever had. I hope this comes close. I don't have to say much more, let's get straight into it. I forgot I have a tradition, every time I do a cruiser review I attempt a Vortex, so... Fucking waste. I'm sorry, I'm fucking ashamed at that attempt, but I like to keep full transparency, so I'm not just going to cut it out and pretend it didn't happen. Plus, you can tell here, but anyway. Sorry, I forgot the rating. 8 out of 10, it's fucking good, but the other one was better. So, this has that classic cruiser taste. It could do with a little bit of tang in the aftertaste. Slightly bitter, but it's a nice clean lychee taste, can't really complain. I reckon you'll fucking love it if you like lychee.
