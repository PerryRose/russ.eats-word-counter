Righto, I've just gotten out of the pool and I don't have much time, so it's my first review in Arashi. They're back in by the way. Ghost Energy Drinks from 7-Eleven. I swear they were already there, but they're doing a lot of promoting. I haven't tried them, so let's fucking do it. By the way, these aren't aimed at us. Fucking nerds that drink energy drinks. They're aimed at shredders. Or when I was young, we called them muzzers. They went to stereo. If you didn't know what a muzzer was, this is it. They go to stereo, fucking Calvin Harris, and just get fucking jacked, bros. All I remember is Marcus Dibble hated muzzers, and then I googled his name, and it turns out he's now a registered sex offender. Fuck, maybe muzzers weren't that bad, Dibble, you fuckwit. Let's go, I've got four to get through, starting with the original lemon lime. Hardly any aftertaste, but a very lolly, sweet lolly lemon aftertaste. Not bad. Six out of ten. Sour Watermelon Warheads. Eight out of ten. That's got some fucking twang. Super fake lolly watermelon with some tang. That's quite nice. I can't believe this. Orange Cream, after the fucking weeks we've had lately with orange creams. Anyway. Six out of ten for a liquid orange cream. That isn't that bad. Blue Raspberry. That's fucking delicious, just like a kablooey. Overall, this range is pretty good.
