Righto, so I've been informed it's not very stable. I've got some of the pub squashes in a can I just don't think I think that cans and bottles taste different So I want this to be like-for-like gonna get straight into it Don't know yet, I actually know this is kind of fun There's a lot more lemon and a weird aftertaste in that one That's lift, that's solo, am I right? I'm not right? Really? That's familiar, that's lift What the fuck, I don't know, I'm getting all these wrong, I'm not as good as I think I am That's the only one I haven't tasted, it has to be sprite lemon It's not, it's not Really? No Well it's off, maybe that lift was old, that's the lift That's lift, yes Alright, I have no idea, they all taste different but I didn't know which was which That's really shit
