Righto, all year I've been waiting for this. The top treats of 2023. We will be immortalizing these on another RussFest t-shirt, by the way. Link in bio. There's also only one yellow t-shirt, because I thought that was fucking cool. Last year's shirt was inspired by heavy metal, but this year's is a psychedelic-inspired design. Because of these Magnum 60s Nine range Jimi Hendrix, you fucking get it. In this video, I'll be doing it by categories, but the overall lineup is not in categories. Starting with confectionery, Cadbury was fucking excellent. Honorable mention to these two beside me. But it's Nutella biscuits that take first place. They were just like Dunkaroos in the perfect fucking ratio. They were excellent. Fast food, what a shit year for this. They dished out some absolute fucking dog food. These are the only two worth mentioning. First place for Hot Honey Chicken. Tower Burger was mad, though. What a year for piss. Honorable mention for this one, mainly because of Val Holmes' slip-up. But I've got a tie in first place between Hard Solo and Twister. You can't really argue there. For non-alcoholic, an honorable mention to these two, but Ultra Peachy Keen, holy fucking shit. In the savory world, honorable mention to these two. I wish you could find these in more places, but first place goes to the Chipotle Pringles. I do a tube a week. The category of the year is the frozen section. Honorable mention to these one. This would have won it, but it disappeared. I don't know what happened. And the number one treat of the year, the Star Chaser Magnum, which I've just fucking noticed I've gotten wrong and called the Stargazer. That makes more sense. Let's start a petition to change the name because I've already printed these fucking shirts. Buy one in the bio. Worst treats of the year coming tomorrow. Fucking hell.
