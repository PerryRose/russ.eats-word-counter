Righto, two more Billsons flavours. I can't fucking keep up, but we've got Maple Bacon, Vanilla Crepes and Pink Lemonade. I'm gonna predict I'm gonna have two of the pink and one in the sink. So as you would have seen in the April Fools yesterday, I got sent these three cans, and they were all full, and I honestly thought they were full of fucking soda water or something, but anyway, one of them was actually real, I found out midway through yesterday, so I thought, we'll chuck it into this review. Sounds pretty fucking shit though, if you ask me, but let's do it. That is just carbonated maple syrup, the kind of shit Canadians would drink. I'm only gonna give it a 3 out of 10 because I'm not getting much bacon or vanilla. It's not offensive, but dessert flavours to me just don't work as well in a soda. Now, let's do Pink Lemonade. These are two absolute goat drinks. I thought Pink Lemonade was Pink Grapefruit Lemonade, but apparently it's just normal lemonade with strawberry or raspberry added to it. Anyway, let's go. That's fucking mad, that's one of the few flavours I reckon I could drink more than two of. It's definitely a strawberry aftertaste. Refreshing as fuck, 8 out of 10.
