Right, I have the Kinder Joy. I'm a little bitch for a Kinder Surprise. I have no fucking idea what this is, but it caught my eye and I'm curious, so we're gonna have a look and see if it's any good. Okay, I've got to do an unboxing, because this is one of the most high-tech fucking Chockies I've ever had. It splits into two halves, then you've got a fucking little cardboard spoon. In here, you've got the toy. Now, Kinder Surprise toys are fucking shit these days. If you're gonna kill a turtle with all that plastic, at least make it worth it. Then in this half is the actual Chockie itself. Pretty interesting. It's like two little Ferrero Rochers with like a, I guess you'd call it the Bueno filling. I don't fucking know, but it looks pretty good. There's just not that much. Let's try it. Let's do it. Now, this was three bucks. Three bucks for two little Ferrero Rochers, some Nutella, and cum. Anyway. Okay, this is like these on fucking steroids. These were already for the rich kids, and these are three bucks each. So these are like for the Geelong Grammar School, Knox Grammar or like the King's School kids. Three bucks is a piss take, and for that, and the amount of fucking plastic, for that, I'm giving this a five out of ten. It is pretty tasty though. Oh, it is pretty tasty.
