Righto, so it's a Friday night and sometimes I like to have a little bit, just a little bit of piss and going to Mexican for dinner, so I thought I'd get in the mood with a classic margarita UDL. Let's go. It's not a margarita without a salted rim. Actually, my rim was assaulted yesterday too. I had a colonoscopy yesterday if you didn't watch my other video. Let's go. Oh, the salt shit, I'm going to have a go without the salt, salt free. Nah, four out of 10. It's like a solo with a shit aftertaste. UDL, stop trying to appeal to the older market and accept the fact that your target market are 16 year olds at the fucking skate park. Bring out a cotton candy flavor or a fucking fortnight can. We don't drink UDLs, kids do.
