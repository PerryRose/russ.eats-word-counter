Righto, the Rustot Easter Bun Hunt, we've got the Pizza Shapes Hot Cross Buns, but first, some Arnott's Goss. They are bringing out this new range called Treaties, okay? This was leaked to me the other day. They've got mint, Neapolitan, caramel and double chocolate. They look like this, right? In cretty bites, but wrapped in chocolate. I'm keen as fuck. That's all the info I have at the moment. Anyways, another savory Hot Cross Bun. This one was the shittest product of 2023 with four skins through it, but this one, I gave a 5.5 out of 10, but 10 out of 10 when camping. The way I describe it is you've got your rich baker's delight buns, but you've got your scum of the earth camping buns that save your life when you're fucking on the piss for seven days straight. So I'm hoping these are the scum of the earth equivalent of the fucking baker's delight savory roll. Okay, this is what they look like. They smell exactly like Shapes. They're basically a savory bun infused with fucking tomato powder, parmesan, blah, blah, blah. Cold one first. Not off to a good start. Can some butter save it? Okay, butter didn't save it, but can some heat save it? Nah, sorry. They are sad. Okay. They're like a fucking cheap as bread roll. You think they're going to taste like Shapes, but you get this almost sour overpowering herby aftertaste. I wouldn't even like these camping. They're fucking absolutely dreadful. I'd go a baked bean jaffa or the cheap ass cheese and bacon rolls over these fuckers any day. Three out of 10.
