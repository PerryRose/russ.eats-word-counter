Righto, Haribo Volcano Fizz, so I'm reviewing these for two reasons. The first reason is they're the first liquid centre lolly I've seen since starburst squirts, if you remember these, they were fucking loose. The second reason is I've had shitloads of messages saying to try these, they've been hyped up as the best lollies they've had in years, so let's see. Quick close up, fair bit of shit in the middle, but it doesn't matter how hard you try, they don't fucking squirt. It's actually the story of my life. So I'm going to try one of each flavour, but look how confusing this is, fucking sour apples in the middle of all of them, and the sour apple's red, and then lemon's orange, orange is blue, and grapefruit's fucking green. Anyway. Oh yeah, fair bit of twang, there's a bit of twang. They're good, they're no starburst squirts, and they do kind of all taste the same, they're just like a normal gummy bear with a really tangy sour centre, so 8 out of 10.
