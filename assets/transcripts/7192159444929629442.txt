Right-o, Nutella biscuits. Now this bag was six bucks, so about 50 cents a bicky, but for some reason I'm okay with it because I've always perceived Nutella as being like an upper-class rich person spread. Now I don't know if that perception is just me, but I only remember the rich kids bringing these to school. I'm ashamed, but I have vivid memories of fucking begging a kid just for a lick of the foil because I was that desperate for a taste of Nutella. Anyways, let's get into it. Crunchy biscuits with a creamy heart of Nutella. Fucking looks alright, let's go. Holy fuck, these are a dunkaroo in biscuit form. I fucking love dunkaroos, so I'm giving these a 9 out of 10. The ratio is fucking perfect, the perfect amount of bicky to fucking Nutella. Give them a shot. If you remember and like dunkaroos, buy these. These are fucking mad.
