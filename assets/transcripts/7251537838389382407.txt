Righto, usually I don't do the exclusive 7-Eleven treats, but I fuckin' had to because of this word here. Cookie Man. This has unlocked such a deep, hidden memory. Do you guys remember the Cookie Man shop? I fully fuckin' forgot about it, and apparently it's the same- the same people. The Cookie Man brandy snap cookies go down in the Stewart family history. These are a work- these were a delicacy. We used to go out of our way to Tuggera Shopping Center and fuckin' West Point at Blacktown just to get these. Let's have a look at them. I did 20 seconds in the microwave, too. We've got the Snickerdoodle, which is cinnamon topped with a caramel filling, and then we've got chopped chip with a choc hazelnut filling. Startin' with the Snickerdoodle, also, I don't deserve this treat. We just got beat by an under-12s fuckin' team in- in Touch Footy. So I'm pretty upset with myself, anyway. Okay, so it's a fuckin' Mad Bicky. Super buttery, and I can tell that it's a Cookie Man cookie. Cinnamon on the top. The only downfall is this was $4, and that was on special. I think it's $5 normally, and the filling-to-price ratio is what's turnin' me off a little bit. 7 1⁄2 out of 10 for that reason. Chopped chip. Way more filling in that one. That's also a 7 1⁄2 out of 10. One of the best pre-packaged cookies that I've ever had. Makes Byron Bay cookies look like a fuckin' bunch of fucks, but they're pricey. Good, but pricey.
