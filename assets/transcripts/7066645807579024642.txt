Righto, I wanted to try something really weird from the lolly shop today. I was looking for the salt and vinegar insects that they had to try, but they didn't have them. But I found this, Van Holten's dill pickle with hearty dill flavour and no refrigeration needed. Now, the only way to describe how this feels is it feels exactly like a fucking dildo. It is a thick slug of a pickle in there, just surrounded with a heap of all that juice. Let's give it a go. Righto, contents of one pickle. Let's get it out. Oh, that stinks. Oh, there it is. All right, get in. Here we go, full kiwi. Two.
