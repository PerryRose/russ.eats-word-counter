Righto, Doritos, Guacamole and Salsa. Firstly, I'm not the biggest fan of the two flavoured chips in the one bag. Reminds me of when there was like a bowl of chips at a party and they'd top up the chicken with salt and vinegar and fuck everything. Hot Wings and Ranch is the only exception to that. Secondly, it's already been done. Guacamole and Salsa was part of the collide range. Now if I don't remember it being that good, it mustn't be good enough to bring back. It's not like Cool Ranch where you can just bring it back every five years and we all fucking skits up. Anyways, let's go. Have a look. Oh, fucking weird. I hate green chips and then they're giving us 50% of the pack green. Guac first. Oh. That's fucked up. It tastes like fucking grass. That's shit. That's fucking... That's offensive. I'm giving that a fucking 2 out of 10. I'm gonna try the Salsa. Oh. Cleans the shit out from the last chip. Salsa's alright. It's just like the Mexicana or something, but a bit weak. Both together. Mmm. It's probably the most mediocre release ever. You've got a grass chip that's a 2 out of 10. You've got like a 6 out of 10 Salsa. 4 out of 10 for both together. Don't bother. Just get Cheese Supreme and get Guacamole. Don't bother. Just get Cheese Supreme and get Guacamole as dips. Just stick to that.
