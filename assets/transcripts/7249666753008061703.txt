Righto, Rust Eats Around The World Part 4, we're doing America. Aldi has all this shit for the 4th of July, so let's get into it. Kicking it off with OG Pop Tarts. People complain that Americans eat these for breakfast, but I have a litre of iced coffee and diarrhoea most mornings, so I'm not complaining. 6 out of 10. I love the texture, but the chocolate flavour is like Bilo brand chocolate topping. Hershey's Chocolate Kisses. These kind of gross me out because my cat is very furry and a couple of times he's had diarrhoea and everywhere he's sat, he's left a little chocolate kiss. So this kind of fucking makes me feel a bit sick, but anyway. Tastes like advent calendar chocolate and is very grainy. Then we've got Milk Dud's Little Chocolate Caramels. That's the middle. They're similar to Fantails. I'm giving them an 8 out of 10. Cookies and Cream Hershey's. It's absolutely fucking loaded. That's mad. 7 out of 10. It's like the Milky Bar one, but with more cookies. Reese's Pretzels. 9 out of 10. Crunchy, salty, sweet. Fucking awesome. The Buttfingerer. 8.5 out of 10. I fucking love the texture of these. So peanut buttery. 3 out of 10 for the Payday. Shit caramel covered in even shit of peanuts. 4 out of 10 for the Baby Ruth. Tastes like an Aldi Snickers. Texan Barbecue Lays. I can't get over how much these smell like fart when you open the pack. It is fucked. They don't taste like fart. 8 out of 10. Thin barbecue chips. Shit on crinkle cut. 6 out of 10 for the Sour Cream. Exactly the same as the Smith's Thins ones.
