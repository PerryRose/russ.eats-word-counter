Arnott's Obsession, their take on an indulgent cookie range. First things first, only six cookies in the pack for $5.50 and only 120 grams. So to put that in perspective, Oreos, you cheap shit, it's fucking 270 grams and like a dollar. A block of chocolate, so full choc, 180 grams. These are only 120. And the packaging does look like it was designed on fucking Microsoft Word in about five minutes. And no gold trim. If you're charging $5.50 for a box, at least put some fucking reflective gold on the lettering or some shit. Oh, they're fucking tiny. They are tiny. Look at that. You're kidding. Oh, there's a bit of shit. They look all right in the middle. I've got to try this. All right. They are next level. They're fucking awesome. It's like chocolate cake batter on the top, crunchy biscuit at the bottom, heaps of chocolate. Nine out of 10, but I'm dropping it to a seven because of the price and size. But, but try them if you're fucking kidding me. They are tiny. Look at that. You're kidding. Oh, there's a bit of shit. They look all right in the middle. I've got to try this. All right. I'm dropping it to a seven because of the price and size, but, but try them if you're fucking loaded. If you're rich, get them all day.
