Righto, the return of kettle honey-baked ham. So a bit of history with the old honey-baked ham, these, in my opinion, were the ultimate symbol of wealth. If you've seen a fucking packet of these on the table at a party, you just knew their dad worked in the mines or sold gear. Rich people chips, that's what these were. Now, for reference, they were rich chips, this behind me is normal people food. Little fucking onions that no one wanted, heaps of cheese, never enough Cavanossi, there was always a French onion dip and either chicken crimpies or jats, and I don't know what, no one fucking liked them, but there was always milk arrowroots with fucking icing and lollies on them like a little face. I've went off topic as usual, let's give them a go. I'm disappointed, I'm getting no nostalgia flashbacks, so I don't know if I don't remember what honey-baked ham tasted like or if they're completely fucking different. They're still nice, so I'm going to give them a 7 out of 10. I still want you to try them though, because I don't know if it's me or them, so I need someone else to help me here.
