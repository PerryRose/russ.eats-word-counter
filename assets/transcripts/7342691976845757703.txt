Righto, the new Passion Fruit Frenzy Mountain Dew at 7-Eleven and I forgot to review the Major Melon No Sugar, so I'll sneak that in too. Also, I've mentioned it before, there is hard Mountain Dew in America, but the thing is, they're all zero sugar and they're a fermented base, not a vodka, and someone said they taste like how damp clothes smell, so you can imagine what that's like. But if anyone knows where I can get them in Australia, please let me know. I need to try them myself. Okay, we'll get Major Melon out of the way first. Now, you know when you forget about, like, your Macca's Coke and all the ice cubes melt, that's like a weak as piss fucking disgusting beverage. That's what this tastes like, okay? It's like watermelon juice and Mountain Dew with a heap of melted ice cubes. 3 out of 10, that's really shit. Okay, time for the Pash. I hate the word Pash, by the way. It's what my parents referred to as, like, what I called a hookup. I hate how, like, generations have different words. Like, stiffy. I called it a fat and then a boner as I got older, but I hate the word stiff. Stiffy, fuck off. Anyway. Yeah, 8 out of 10. That's like a slightly fruitier version of a Posido or a Pachiona. I still have them above this, but this is still pretty fucking good. I wish KFC would stock some different Mountain Dew flavours. This with the Zinger box would be fucking insane.
