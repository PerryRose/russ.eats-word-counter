Righto, the freezer section's going off at the moment, another new ice block, the Frosty Fruits fruit stack. If it's not obvious, I fucking love ice blocks, they're my top tier snack, hence why I chose Cyclone as the Bilston's flavour. And to put it in perspective, I can easily polish off a full Frosty Fruits pack in one sitting. I've once done the full 24 pack of Zoopa Doopas in a sitting. And that's not me bragging, that's me reaching out for help. I was so crook after that many Zoopa Doopas, this is what it looked- this is actual footage of inside the toilet bowl after I polished off 24 Zoopa Doopas. Here it is, this is fucking cool, it's sorbet texture, it's not Frosty Fruit texture like classic Frosty Fruit like I thought. Strawberry, orange, apple, and they're little bits of chocolate apparently, let's do this. That's fucking gorgeous, such a fresh, fruity, strawberry sorbet, I'm gonna try the other two flavours. That's also mad, that's like real orange, not very sour, but it's got like that bitter orange aftertaste which I like, and the apple. That's fucking mad too, that's like real apple, little bit of tang in that one too, and I got a little bit of the chocolate, and that kind of works, it's fucking weird. I love this, it's got variety, it's fresh and refreshing tasting, like it feels real if that makes sense. Mad texture, I'm giving that a 9. There's a party happening in the fucking freezer section, there is a fucking party happening.
