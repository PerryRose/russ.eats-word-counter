Righto, we've got Red Rooster Sweet and Sour Crunch. Now you've gotta be careful with sweet and sour sauce, you never know what you're gonna get. It's peach and apricot in your fucking Macca's Sweet and Sour, but then this shit is like pineapple and tomato or something. So this review is really dependent on the sauce, because I already like the chicken, it's the third in the series. We've had Hot Honey and Red's Hot Chicken already. Hi, what can I get for you? Good day darling, can I try some of the Sweet and Sour Crunch? There's a look up close. This is the most covered piece, I feel like it should be absolutely fucking lathered in it. It does just smell like the Masterfood sauce, but let's find out. 7 out of 10, it's nothing special, it is just fried chicken covered in a basic sweet and sour sauce. I'd say it's similar to this one behind me, very sweet with a slight sour aftertaste, but yeah, it is hitting the spot, I don't mind it at all.
