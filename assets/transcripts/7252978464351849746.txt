Right-o, Red Rooster has reached out to me to show you guys their burger range. Yes, I know this is a paid promotion, but I'm taking money from Big Red, because Big Red took money from me, okay? The kids need feedin'. Anyways, Red Rooster in recent years has diversified their portfolio. They were baked dinners, basically, and they still do them. I don't mind them, but if I wanted a baked dinner, I'd go visit me fuckin' mum. I've said that before. I tried their Honey Chicken and their Red's Hot Chicken, and I fuckin' loved it. So let's get into the burger range. Start with the Red's Burger. Original tenders, a nice bit of American cheese, a fuckin' slug of mayo. Let's go. Now the Barbecue Bacon Burger. Onion rings, barbecue sauce, American cheese, bacon. Looks fuckin' mad. And the Spicy Burger. This is the same as the Red's Burger, but each tender's coated with, like, a real peppery smell and sauce. Another thing I'll mention that I'm not getting paid to mention is they've got pineapple fritters. I haven't had one of these in fuckin' ages, and they stock Coke. I fuckin' love a can of vanilla Coke. Overall, I'm giving all of them a 10 out of 10, because I'm a fuckin' sellout, and I'll do anything for money. I'll even sell you these. You want these? Fuckin' send me a message. You can have them for five bucks. I'll do anything for five bucks. Now, to be honest, I'm not reviewing shit in a paid promotion. Try them for yourselves. You guys are the ones that told me about their fried chicken, so let me know what you think about the burgers.
