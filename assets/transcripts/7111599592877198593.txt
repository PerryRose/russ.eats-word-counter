Righto, slushy skittles, so I'm gonna quickly go into what my opinion of what a slushy is. So you've got snow cones, super icy with like a little bit of flavouring on top. These ones were mad from the footy with sherbet and I fucking love them things. Then you've got an icy, slurpy or frozen coke, they're all pretty much the same thing. To me, a slushy is in between a snow cone and a frozen coke. It's kind of like a slush puppy, so bigger bits of ice and actually slushes. And I also think that's what they're trying to be here, look at the front, and the five flavours are the same five flavours as the normal slush puppy. So let's go. Quick unboxing. They look pretty much the same, just in blue. Here's the five flavours. I'm gonna go all at once, then individually. Pretty good, skittles are always good though. So I'm only giving them a 6 out of 10, they just taste like normal skittles with cola. Here's the individual ratings. The cola one is amazing, I'd love a pack of them by themselves. It's a fun idea, slushy is a fun idea, fuck knows why they bought it out in winter. Don't really bother, they're just like normal skittles, unless you really want to try the cola one.
