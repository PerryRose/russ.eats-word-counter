Righto, Junk Food Graveyard Part 13, we're doing Tarzos, technically not food, but they were in food, so we can all agree they fit this series perfectly. Also, I'm doing Tarzos specific to what me and my brother and sister collected. There's going to be heaps that I've missed, so drop them in the comments below. Quick shoutout before I start, the shrinkies, when you would shrink your chip packet and make a keyring out of it. I forgot all about this, but it came up when I was Googling Tarzos, so you can have it. We'll kick it off with what I remember as being the OGs. I was super fucking young, but I remember the Slammers, don't remember how to play, but I also remember this Space Jam Collector's Booklet. Iconic. Then we've got my favourite, the Simpsons Pickers. You had a fucking tennis ball on an elastic strap, and the Tarzos were Velcro. It was revolutionary. Next we've got a video, this is my personal collection, I just recorded this. I always got a fuckload of Mark Minichellos and Milton Thaddeus though, but I love these footy Tarzos. I reckon they're still worth a fortune, except that one, that one's definitely devalued. Then we've got the Crash Bandicoot Stunt Wheels. I was obsessed with these, and this was my rarest one, the Ooga Ooga. If you've got the Ooga Booga, please, please, I'll swap you a holographic Todd Carney for it. What you did was flick them at the characters, these were a fun time. These were probably my second favourite Tarzos. Then we've got the Dragon Ball Z. If you've got the fluoro or the gold Super Saiyan Goku, you were the coolest kid in school, fucking promise ya. Then we've got the Yu-Gi-Oh! Metallix Tarzos. I had a bit of a guilt trip when I seen Yu-Gi-Oh!, I forgot all about it. I used to collect Yu-Gi-Oh! cards, but I'd get the cheap ones made in Thailand from the markets, then swap the rich kids for their real cards and put them on eBay. Bit of a guilt trip here.
