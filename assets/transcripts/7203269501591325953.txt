Righto, Lemonade Popsicle Billsons. Now this better be fucking good, otherwise it's going to be awkward. Because I'm currently at the Billsons Brewer House for a little top secret meeting tomorrow about the Rust Eats flavour. So it's going to be fucking awkward if this is shit. Anyway, sorry about the lighting. I'm actually recording this from a hotel floor. But anyway, let's get into it. Now we're on the topic of lemonade ice blocks. I thought I'd have to fucking tell you is that I actually have a Lil' Lemonade Rugrats ice block in my freezer. Someone who follows me found it in the back of their freezer, a 20-year-old ice block. They posted it to me. Unfortunately, when it melted, the liquid escaped out of a slight crack, but most of it is saved. So yes, I will be trying a 20-year-old ice block in the coming weeks. Also, if I'm going to say my favourite lemonade ice block, it goes to Paddle Pop Icy Twist. This thing is fucking awesome. The Slick Stick's my second favourite, purely from nostalgia. May it rest in peace. Anyways, let's do it. Okay, that's fucking spot-on. That is literally a melted lemonade icy pile. If you were half-pissed in the pool on a 40-degree day, I reckon this would be a 10 out of 10. But on the hotel floor, I'm giving it an 8.5. It could be fizzier, but I feel like that was on purpose, and it is quite sweet. But if you love lemonade ice blocks, you'll fucking love this.
