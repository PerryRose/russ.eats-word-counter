What's the best collaboration of the year, you know when people team up and they get a little bit of this and a little bit of that, ice creams and chocolates and whatever and they create the one treat? What's the best collaboration? I don't think it's just the best collaboration, I think it's the treat of the year. I was going to hold this for like a Hottest 100, but the Kit Kat Milo Chunky is my treat of the year so far. So if something can, how long we got left? Two months left? Yeah. If something can come out and beat it? The Kit Kat Milo Chunky. Not the normal Kit Kat Milo? Yeah. That one doesn't have enough Milo? The Chunky Kit Kat with Milo.
