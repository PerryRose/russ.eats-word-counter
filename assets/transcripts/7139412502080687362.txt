Right-o, the shittest products to hit the shelves, part three. Starting with mint leaves. The fact that Starbursts are off the shelves, but these remain actually makes me sick. These are so crap. I know there's a cult following, I don't care. They're shit. Now this might piss a few people off, but it's not just mint leaves. These are all plain boring, some of the shittest lollies I ever had. I hated them growing up. Milk bottles, chocolate freckles, and the little white chocolate buns. That was the worst white chocolate I've ever had. Witchitty grubs, it just tasted like foam or something. And then these bananas, which are just crap. They were always in a bag. I don't even know who fucking made them. In a little sappy bag, and if you were lucky you get like two little race cars. Next we've got the Heinz Easy Squirt. I actually remember when these came out. Colored tomato sauce. There was nothing wrong with red tomato sauce. The purple one looked like Barney the Dinosaur or Thanos shot a dirty load all over your food. Fucking filthy. Next we've got the McCooler Burger from the 60s. Now, it's obvious why this didn't work. A fucking piece of pineapple with two bits of cheese. It looks like one of the most sad items of food I've ever seen in my life. A bloke on YouTube actually recreated it, and when he described it as slippery, I just knew it was gonna be horrible. And you can see by the look in his eyes, he was not impressed either. Last but not least, the Cheese Tim Tam. So this was released overseas, where they actually do have a lot of cheese flavored stuff. But to me, this is probably the shittest combo I've ever heard of. I thought it was a joke.
