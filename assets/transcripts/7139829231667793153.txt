Righto, in a biscuit and back with another flavour, Loaded Cheese. Now you can see on the packet, these are triangular. These are not the Big Cheese, I am sorry, I said Big Cheese was coming back, it's not. I already know these are different because the Big Cheese was this shape, like Swiss Cheese shaped biscuits. This was the OG line up by the way, Crispy Potato, Vegemite, the Big Cheese, which was my favourite, Crispy Bacon, and they have bought back Dixie Drumstick and Chicken already. Let's have a look at them, by the way, 14 for one serve. That's a bit more reasonable, fucking two cubes of chocolate the other day, that pissed me off. They smell like Cheezels, they smell heaps like Cheezels, and quite puffy actually, nothing like the Big Cheese. Let's go. So there are heaps like these that I tried the other day, the Cheezels crackers, Dixie Drumstick texture with a Cheezels taste, they melt in your mouth more, but there's less cheese flavouring than these, so I'm gonna give them the same rating of a 7 out of 10. So if you're desperate for the Big Cheese, these are as close as possible to the Big Chee... Fuck me, I've said Big Cheese that many times in this fucking video. These taste like the Big Cheese, the other ones taste like Cheezels, so if you like Big Cheese, eat these, if you like Cheezels, eat the others, pretty fucking simple. I've decided if the first person to correctly guess how many times I've said the Big Cheese wins, fucking, there's about 17 left of this big a pack, fucking promise.
