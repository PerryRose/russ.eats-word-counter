Righto, we live in one of the few countries where you get free, clean water to basically any tap in the whole fucking country. But that's not good enough, okay? We want $6.50 water, imported from fucking Austria, and we're happy to pay it because it's got some heavy metal writing on the fucking can. Now, I do want to mention there is good and bad water, okay? Okay? Some of the bottles are good, some are shit. I actually drove all the way to Bato Bay once to drink water from a fresh spring, and it was the best water I've ever had, except it wasn't that clean, and I did have to take a shit on the side of the Pacific Highway. But it was fucking good water. Anyways, we'll start with the plain water, okay? Flat fucking water. Okay, that's a weird sensation. Water from a can is fucking weird. I don't know. It's literally just—it's just water. That's not surprising. The sparkling water. Okay, that felt normal because it was fizzy, but you could just soda stream your water at home. And severed lime. There's also a mango chainsaw, but I couldn't find it. Okay, that one's like a Mount Franklin lime, lightly sparkling. So that one makes sense. I'm going to give it a 4 out of 10, but it's $6.50 water imported from fucking Austria, okay? I cannot back this. I know people are paying $80 for a fucking Frank Green water bottle, but you are fucking—this is aimed at the dumbest of dumb fucking people, or people that just want to waste money. That has to be a zero. Canned water from fucking Austria.
