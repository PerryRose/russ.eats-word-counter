Righto, another seasonal release, the Spiced Ginger Beer by Bundaberg. This comes out every year, but there is a reason I haven't tried it yet. And that reason is right behind me. Little Fat Lamb. I had this for the first time in 2015. I even found photo proof. Here is me in 2015 at Festival of the Sun in Port Mac. I haven't even cracked the Fat Lamb yet, so this is the last photo of me before trying Fat Lamb. Then there's this photo a few hours later where you can tell it started to go downhill. I rang my mate Sully to help me recount some of the events where apparently I passed out in his tent and then when he went to go to sleep he dragged me out and he thought that I had shit all through his tent. But it was worse. I actually fell asleep on his Ritchie Didge meat pie and smeared it all over his tent. So he rolled me out in the rain and I missed Jebediah and I haven't drank ginger beer since. Since this year that is. I'm back on it. I'm back on the gingies. Anyway, let's go. Listen to the pop. There we go. I'm going to try to get it inverted before opening like it says. Oh my, that's a festive little frosty fucking... Seriously, this takes ginger beer to another level. They add cinnamon and cloves to all this shit and call it Christmas flavour, but adding it to a ginger beer just fucking works so well. I think this is the best ginger beer I've ever tried. I'm going to give this a 9 out of 10. This is phenomenal. This is a Christmas miracle. It's a fucking Christmas miracle.
