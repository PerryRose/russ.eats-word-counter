Righto, with only a few days left, the hunt for festive piss goes on. We've got two flavoured ginger beers, raspberry sour and pineapple. Now before we get started, a little bit off topic, but today marks four years since the biggest catfish of all time. I ordered this Jim Carrey mask mask for a secret Santa present and this fucking showed up. Seriously, what the fuck is this? It looks like Shrek's been on a three-day bender. That is not Jim Carrey's mask. And I know what you're thinking, who would want this as a secret Santa present? Well, who the fuck wants your box of roses and glass house candle is what I ask. I'd much rather this thoughtful gift. Back to the review, now I wish they would do more flavoured ginger beers. This is pretty much all we've got. I am so fucking keen on this. Raspberry and pineapple with a ginger beer sounds like the ultimate summer drink. Kicking it off with the raspberry sour. Yeah, fuck, eight and a half out of ten. Super fresh raspberry, like a real raspberry flavour, but it's not sour, but that is a treat. And the pineapple by Big Things Brewing Co. I've never heard of them, but I got both of these from Dan's and BWS. Cheers. Yeah, get fucked. That's a nine out of ten. It's like fresh pineapple juice mixed with ginger beer, a summer delight. I hope this is the beginning of more fruity ginger beers to come. I'm impressed, okay?
