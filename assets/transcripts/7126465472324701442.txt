Right-o, the new fully loaded range by Shapes. Can't be bothered doing three videos so I'm gonna review the lot. Firstly, these remind me of Shapes roadies. The shape of them is identical to the roadies Shapes. If you don't remember these, these were fucking mad. Now before I start the review, there's something super fucking sus about the flavor choice. In a biscuit, Shapes biggest competitor has come back recently with the chicken flavors and I've seen that they're bringing out smoky meat lovers and loaded cheese. Seriously, this can't be a fucking coincidence. Sizzling meat lovers, smoky meat lovers. Flame-grilled chicken, chicken, ultimate cheese, loaded cheese. There's a spy in the cracker world who's dobbing. This can't be a coincidence. So it's supposed to be off-the-scale flavor and crunch. Here's the meat lovers, the chicken and the cheese. Looks like there's off-the-scale flavor on the cheese but it doesn't look like that to the meat lovers and here is the shape. Pretty thin. Let's give them a go. Meat lovers, flame-grilled chicken and the ultimate cheese. They literally are Shapes roadies, I shit you not. So if you never had roadies, they're like a thinner and crunchier shape. Meat lovers, tastes like barbecue ribs. Six and a half out of ten, could have more flavor. Flame-grilled chicken just tastes like the roast chicken. I don't love chicken flavors so that's just a seven out of ten but fuck me, the ultimate cheese tastes like a mixture between the big cheese and the old cheddar and potato skins flavor. Eight and a half out of ten, awesome.
