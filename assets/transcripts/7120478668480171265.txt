Righto, we're doing part four of the junk food graveyard energy drinks. I'm starting with LOL now These were just carbonated juice, but we all pretended they were an energy drink So they're kind of a gateway energy drink into the addiction. We all have today Next we've got what I'd say are the original V flavors Yeah, the original green then black berry and lemon and if you tried these, you know what I'm talking about Then as we got older we moved on to alcoholic energy drinks and pulse to me was the OG If you had two four packs of these you were fucked. It was pretty much a pinger if I mentioned pulse I gotta mention elevate because sometimes you couldn't afford pulse So you needed this shit and there was just as effective but tasted pretty filth Then we've got the original set of mother flavors mainly orange surge and lemon bite But to be honest, I didn't mind green storm and revive Honorable mention to cocaine energy drink I never tried one but my mate had one and I thought he was I still think he's cool for having it
