Righto, the Junk Food Graveyard Part 14 Piss Part 2. Now Part 1 was so fun to do and it made me feel a lot better because I didn't know how many other people shared the same experiences on these drinks. I thought it was just me and my mates that were fucked up, but it turns out we're all fucked up. Kicking it off with Passion Pop, we all did Passion Pop, it was just one step above Goon in my opinion. Then we've got the Carlton Cold Shot. This was a Carlton Cold with a shot of vodka. It sounds like the filthiest drink that I've ever heard of. Now I'm going to flash back to the drinks that I think turned us into pissheads. These are the drinks that we see in our mums drinking that look so fucking tasty. For me, that was Vodka Cruiser. They used to have so many fucking good flavours, but it was the OG Blueberry in this exact glass that I remember my mum drinking and me like fucking getting the dregs out of the bin. Some other mum drinks was the Bacardi Breezer and the West Coast Cooler. Then we've got the Red Bear in this exact packaging. My mate Mullet was a little bitch for these. But personally, I thought UDL was better, especially Passion Fruit. Now this one means a lot to me. If I had money, I was getting a Woodstock One Footer. 4 40ml cans, these were the fucking best. The Absinthe Fairy Bomb that was apparently pulled from shelves in a few months. Then there's these two milk-based drinks that you would only drink once because of what they did to your guts. The Mud Shake and the Shot Bucket. And finally, it is a tie for the most fucked up drinks of the 21st century. Smirnoff Double Black and Little Fat Lamb.
