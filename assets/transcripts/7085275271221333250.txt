Righto, Ben & Jerry's cookie dough ice cream pieces, just like the Golden Gaytimes little bite size ice creams, but wait, these were $10 for 10 tiny little pieces. Have a look, that's how big the fucking bag is, tiny little bag for $10. So I'm going to do some quick maths, have a look at this. So per 100 millilitres, we've got $6.25 for these Ben & Jerry's, $2.80 for the normal Ben & Jerry's, $1.20 for your connoisseur range, and for your fucking scum of the earth shit, it's $0.17 per 100 millilitres, so this is literally 50 times more expensive than your vanilla Coles ice cream, so they better be good. I'm not even kidding, that's how big, they are $1 each, they are $1 each, they are only that fucking big. Give it a sec, I'll try them. Alright, they're nice, they've got crunchy cookie crumbs and cookie dough, but they're not $1 each, that's a fucking scam, fuck you Ben, fuck you Jerry, 5 out of 10.
