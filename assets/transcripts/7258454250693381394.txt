Righto, I'm so fucking keen on this. Hard Solo. You're probably wondering how I got this so early when it's not released yet. I had to do some filthy things. Now, Solo is similar to Harry Potter. They've had to follow their target audience as we've grown up and made it scarier and scarier. They added energy when we were teenagers and now they're adding piss when we're older. Now, I'm gonna predict as we get older, Solo's gonna go into the Voltaren market and they may end up here. Now, that would be a hard Solo. Let's fucking do this. Also, it doesn't say vodka. It just says neutral spirit. I don't know what that is. If you do, please let me know in the comments. That is fucking good. Light on fizz so you can get pissed fast. I've got to compare it to the fucking OG to see how close it really is. There is no fucking difference. I swear, there is no difference between these. That is dangerous. Is this the beginning of no more soft drinks and more hard drinks? Imagine a Pepsi Max and bourbon or a fucking hard Fanta. This is amazing. I'm giving this a 9 out of 10. I am impressed.
