Right-o, the hunt for festive piss continues. Gingerbread and Candy Cane Billsons. I just woke up from a nap to about 500 notifications. I've never been sent a product more in my life. I thought someone died. I did not know what the fuck was going on. Then I started freaking out and thought maybe I put like a dick pic as my story accidentally. But no, Billsons just posted these two drinks and I'm okay. Let's start with the gingerbread. It smells incredible. That is fun. That is festive as fuck, but I reckon I can only drink about two of them. It's like a real mild ginger and then this sweet like gingerbread aftertaste. That's my dessert weapon of choice. I'm having that with me Chrissy Pud and a shitload of custard. That's an eight and a half out of ten. Now the candy cane flavor. That is interesting. I've never had a mint soft drink before. I thought it was going to taste like Listerine and soda water, but it's kind of like lemonade when you've still got chewy in your mouth. That's the only way I can describe it. It's quite cute. I don't think it's my festive piss of choice. Maybe if I can't be fucked brushing my teeth, I'll just smash a can of this. Probably give this one a six and a half out of ten. It is accurate. It is a candy cane soft drink. So if you think that sounds mad, give it a go, but I don't know.
