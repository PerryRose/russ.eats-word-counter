Right-o. The third in the new Marvelous Creations range, Rocky Road. I thought I'd have a bit of fun and put it head-to-head with the Daryl Lee Rock Lee Raspberry. Firstly, Cadbury have been pretty sneaky here. Two of the new three Marvelous Creations flavours are old flavours. Birthday Cake was already out, Rocky Road was already out. Fuckin' annoying. Let's kick this head-to-head off. So ingredients, you've got marshmallows in both, peanuts in both, coconut in both, but you've got cherry jellies in this one and raspberry jellies in this one. Fuck. Way bigger marshmallows. Fuckin' hell. Quick comparison first, both are $5 full price, but you've got 180 grams, where the fuckin' Dairy Milk's actually 190 grams, which wins there. But you get bonus points for this being a more convenient square block. I fuckin' hate breaking these. Starting with the Kazza. And now the Dazza. So the only positive with the Cadbury is I think the chocolate's slightly better, but it is a fuckin' shit take on a Rocky Road block. It's all coconut and peanut. That's all I'm getting. This on the other hand, heaps of chewy jellies and marshmallows. It's just a lot better of a fuckin' Rocky Road experience. Five and a half out of ten? Seven and a half out of ten. Give them a go. Let me know. Righto.
