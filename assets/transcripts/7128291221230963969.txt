Righto, so I know it's Friday and I usually drink a little bit of piss but I'm actually hungover as fuck from work drinks last night so Guava Lava to bring me back to life for the weekend. I'm keen as fuck on this because Purple Rockstar is tropical guava flavor and it is in my top three energy drinks it's fucking god tier in my opinion so let's go. Smells similar. Oh yeah. Oh yeah, exactly like I thought it's just like the Purple Rockstar maybe a bit of a sweeter aftertaste. I think Purple Rockstar is a nine and a half out of ten so I'm gonna give this a nine. I'll buy whichever ones I'm fucking special to be honest they're that similar.
