Right-o, the Fanta Mystery Flavor. I'm already disappointed. This is no sugar Fanta, which pisses me off. Uh, Pringles did the same guessing competition a few years ago. It was a fun time. I thought it was fun. Anyway, this thing, toxic as fuck. It looks like a bottle of Windex. And, have a go at the bottle shape. I thought it was a fucking dinted bottle. This is legit. That's the fucking shape. Anyway, let's go. Oh, it's fucking shit. Oh, they have not nailed that sugar-free taste. Give us a sec. So, it's a 3 out of 10. It's fucking horrible. It just tastes like chemicals. I wouldn't even class it as a beverage. It's like a toiletry. It's basically a toiletry. My guess on the flavor is creaming soda or toffee apple mixed with Windex, piss, and shit.
