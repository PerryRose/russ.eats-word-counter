Righto, Tropical Tang V, the first full sugar release in fucking years. I remember the good old days when V would bring out a new flavour like every three months. We have not had a new flavour since Raspberry Lemonade, and then before that I think it was Golden Fruits and then Blue V. And these, by the way, were all absolutely gorgeous. I still guzzle the fuck out of these two. Anyways, let's get into it. This only comes in a 500ml can from what I've seen too, which pisses me off, because I like just sometimes a little treat to have a little 250ml. And that's why I hate Modstup, because you can't. Anyway, there's a real pungent smell coming from this already. Yeah, I knew it wouldn't disappoint, but up front, just like a pineapple vodka cruiser, you get this like cat's piss smell. Then once you get over that though, you get this awesome tropical taste, and the aftertaste in this is incredible. It's like sherbet, and it's one of the best aftertastes out of any drink I've ever had. I'm giving that an 8.5 out of 10. Fucking awesome, besides the cat piss smell. Please bring out more full sugar V, you can't go wrong.
