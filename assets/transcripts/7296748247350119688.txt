Righto, two new Billsons flavours, Pineapple and Bad Apple. Is it too early to start the hunt for festive piss? I think this qualifies, I'm gonna count this in the hunt, alright? Kicking off with Pineapple, there's the colour. The can is sexy as fuck, by the way, let's go. Fucking hell, I didn't know if they were gonna do Pineapple Juice or Fake Pineapple, and this is somehow both. You get the fake Pineapple up front from the Zoopa Doopa in the smell and taste, and then you get Pineapple Juice like a super refreshing aftertaste. That's incredible, and the bonus is if it's made with real Pineapple Juice, some people claim that Pineapple Juice makes your semen taste better. Personally, I've found semen tastes a lot better when you mix it with orange juice. And the Bad Apple, also I forgot to rate the Pineapple, easy nine, nine and a half out of ten, that's fucking incredible. That could be the drink of the summer, I'm calling it early. Anyway, let's go. Another winner, that is a Green Ghost Drop, okay, and it's similar to Sour Monkey but not as sickening in the sour. It's super well balanced, that's also pretty fucking good, but I couldn't drink as many as I could the Pineapple, so I'm gonna give it an eight and a half out of ten.
