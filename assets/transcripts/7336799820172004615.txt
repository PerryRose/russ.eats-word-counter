Righto, another Russ Eats Creations. I know I'm not the first to use a glazed donut as a bun, but this was launched in KFC in America like four or five years ago, and I've thought about it every day since. So we're getting Krispy Kreme donuts, we're getting a fucking fillet, and we're making this bastard. And what was the last part, sorry? You can sell coffee. Now I know you don't need a tutorial how to put chicken on a fucking donut, and it's funny, Americans will whinge about fluoride in their fucking water, but then they'll eat shit like this. Also, I got Macca's McChicken sauce. I didn't think aioli would work, so I did a quick little detour to Macca's. Have a look at it. It doesn't actually look that impressive, but when I cut it in half, I was thinking, yeah, maybe this will work. Let's rip in. Yeah, okay, that's a lot, but the donut's about 70% of the taste. What it needs is crispy, salty bacon, and then maybe like a maple syrup mayo. I feel like that would be one of the best things ever. I'm gonna give it a seven out of 10. Okay, I probably wouldn't do it again, and I feel a bit sick.
