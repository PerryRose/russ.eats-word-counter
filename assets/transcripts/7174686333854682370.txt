Right-o, Pringles are back with classic fried chicken and classic grilled burger flavour. Weirdly, I could only find these at Aldi, they were not at Woolies and Coles, and they were announced months ago. I reckon it's linked to the potato shortage. That's right, we're in a full spud shortage. That's why the chip aisle's been so bare, and that's why all the frozen McCain's chips have been completely sold out recently. So I reckon that they announced these, then the potato shortage hit, and they could only supply Aldi. That's my guess, anyway. Now, Pringles new flavours have gotten worse and worse over the years, but they topped it when they brought out the veggie creations. These were absolutely fucked. These were one of the worst tasting chips I'd ever had, and then I had Melt's, and now these are second worst. These won my stinker of the year award in 2021. It's pretty obvious what's going to get it in 2022. Let's see if they can redeem themselves, starting with the fried chicken. They're bland as fuck. I swear, they're just normal chicken Pringles. I can maybe taste a bit of Wicked Wing batter, but I think it's placebo effect, because I'm looking at the fucking tube. 5 out of 10. Now the classic grilled burger. They're fun. They're not bad. I actually want to keep eating them. I reckon it does taste like a grilled burger, but it is pretty much like a barbecue Pringle, but then you're definitely getting a lot of onion, tomato, and I swear I'm getting lettuce. I'm going to give these a 7 out of 10. Not bad.
