Righto, the new Glowberry Prime. I wasn't going to review any more Primes because they're absolute fucking bottles of piss. But I'm curious, what is a Glowberry? And there's not many spooky treats, there's hardly any good Halloween shit. They've jumped straight to Christmas, have yous noticed that? So, I'm a bit desperate for some Halloween content. Let's go. It smells like apple and shit choice of colours. It's like they've ripped off the Uber Eats logo. Who the fuck would do that? I'm disappointed. I thought it was going to be a mad berry flavour, but it's a super disappointing apple. It's like the starburst apple with no tang and so much sweetness that your throat burns. It's pretty shit, okay? It's not as shit as some of the others, it's a 4 out of 10, okay? It's somewhere there, so yeah, I probably wouldn't bother.
