Righto, Grilled's Halloween Hellfired Hot Sauce, limited time only, first spooky treat of the year. Yes, this is a paid promotion, but it is an absolute honour. Grilled are the only burgers that do not ruin my guts. Grab the sauce and head off to the junction, where I thought this would pair perfectly with the healthy fried chicken bites. You actually get six for free with the hot sauce, alright? So note that. I got two burgers, because it was Grilled's shout, because I'm hot and famous. Traditional bun as usual, summer sunset, the healthy fried chicken bites, and the Wagyu wonder. And even though I had hot sauce, for some reason I got a lime and jalapeno drink to wash it down with, whatever. Quick reenactment of this photo, when I peaked in 2012, when Hurley shirts were in, the peak of fashion. Absolutely lathered the bites up with this stuff, and this proved to be a mistake. I know I said Grilled had never ruined my guts before, but this was a bit much for me, okay? I was paying $1.10 for a shart tomorrow. To make it worse, I was then showing off in front of my nephew and took a skull, and then I forgot that I didn't have a normal drink, a jalapeno drink. A warning, do not wash it down with a jalapeno drink, okay? The sauce had an awesome habanero flavour, but a bit hot for me. Buffalo sauce is my comfortable limit, this was about level 4 of the Hot Wings Challenge. Now, I don't give ratings in paid promotion, so I left this up to George, where he gave it 2 thumbs up. We didn't actually try it, because that would make me a really bad uncle.
