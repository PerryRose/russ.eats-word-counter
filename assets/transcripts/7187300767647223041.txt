Righto, the new Macca's Aussie launch. We've got the Aussie Angus, the potato scallop with chicken salt, the hokey pokey thick shake and the McSpicy. I've had a million fucking McSpicy, so I'm not gonna try it now. It's an 8 out of 10 if it's fresh, but like all Maccas, it's a piece of shit if it's been sitting there for a while. I'm gonna kick it off with a fucking scandal. The photo here on the app shows an egg, right? But when you click into it, the fucking egg is gone and not listed in the ingredients. So they've either forgotten it here or there's no fucking egg this year. Which is un-Australian if they've removed the egg. Last year, it had an egg. An Aussie burger has an egg. I'm about to fucking drive there right now and figure out if this burger actually does or doesn't have an egg. If it doesn't, Maccas, you can get fucked. I've got the mobile order. It's BG82. B for BGs and G for gnome. What, garden gnome. Yep. Yeah, was that all for gnome? Yep, that's all. Firstly, they forgot me fucking scallops and I had to reverse back. But secondly, have a look at that. No egg. Confirmed, no egg on the Aussie Angus. I'll go with it anyway. That would have been a 9 out of 10 if it had an egg, but I'm gonna give it a fucking 4 because they've dogged us. Now the scallop with chicken salt. That's got fucking nothing on a fish and chip shop scallop. It's like a servo scallop that sat under the fucking bain-marie heat lamps for ages. That's a fucking 3 out of 10 and this tastes like a golden gay time. It's fucking mad. 9 out of 10.
