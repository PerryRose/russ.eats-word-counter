Righto, so a shitload of people commented on my junk food graveyard if I remembered Burgerman from school, and I got googling, because I do remember them, and found out they fucking re-released them in Woolworths about two months ago. So if you don't remember these, it's because you were rich. So these were mainly sold in all your discount stores, like fucking Golo, I forgot about Golo. Um, Pricemart, Reject Shop, all those cheap shops usually sold these next to the Jumpies and the Real McCoy chips. They were the hidden gems of the discount stores that only us, us povo people really got to enjoy. So they smell exactly how I remember, and me Burgerman, they're all fucked up. I don't think there's a full, like, you've got a fucking decapitated one here. Let's give it a go. Yeah, that's a fucking flashback. They're a 7 out of 10. I don't reckon they're as good as Tasty Tubes, but they're kind of similar. If you don't remember them, you probably won't care, but give them a go if you do.
