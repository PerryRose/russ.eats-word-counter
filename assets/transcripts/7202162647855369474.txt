Righto, the Russ.EatsTheEggHunt continues with the Bubble-O-Bill egg. Now, let's be honest, we love the Bubble-O-Bill, but the piece of bubblegum in the centre is one of the most piss-weak pieces of bubblegum you'll ever have. I last longer, that's how shit the bubblegum was on the Bubble-O-Bill. Anyway, let's give it a go. Milk Choc Egg with crunchy caramel and berry flavours and five of the biggest bubblegum noses in the West. Sounds mad, but will it beat the Milk Choc Footy? Let's find out. Okay, so this says it is 6.4 servings. Who the fuck shares an egg with 6.4 people? And I've had an absolute blowout. The arse has blown out the egg and there is five. I thought there was four, don't worry. Let's go. Okay, so it started off good. I got Bubble-O-Bill vibes straight away and these little crunchy bits were fucking mad, but then the aftertaste hit and it's like one of the most poisonous, fake, berry fucked aftertaste ever. It is, it is, I think it's like perfume and martini or some shit. So it was a 7 out of 10, but now it's a 4 out of 10. That's pretty shit.
