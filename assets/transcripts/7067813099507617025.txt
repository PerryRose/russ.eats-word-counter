Righto, so Daryl Lee has got a new block out every fucking week and this week they've let a five-year-old decide the flavor with fruit tingles and raspberry jellies milk chocolate. I don't know why but it reminds me of Ralph Wiggum's crayon sandwich but I'm gonna give it a shot. I'm not gonna knock it till I've tried it so let's give it a go. Sorry, had some trouble with the packaging. There's not really much in there, it's fucking one jelly. Give another bit, there's a bit more, a bit more in there. Let's give it a shot. Lots of little bits in there. I'll need some time on this one. Alright, six out of ten. It's alright, it's kind of like a Marvelous Creations, I don't mind it. Really multi-textural, real hard bits and jelly. It's alright, it's weird.
