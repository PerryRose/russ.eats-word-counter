Righto, we've got Cheezels, crackers, and some breaking news in the cracker world. So firstly, I'm so keen on these because they remind me of these. Big cheese in a biscuit, but here's the breaking news. It's coming back anyway, as loaded cheese. So I don't know if these are going to be better than the OGs, but we're going to fucking find out. Plus, they've also dropped these in the cracker world, so I'm going to be eating a fuckload of crackers this week by the looks of it, but let's start with these. So they smell like Cheezels, and they're actually a lot puffier than I thought. Let's go. Oh yeah. So they're nothing like the big cheese, they're like a Dixie drumstick texture, Cheezel flavour, and then it's really confusing, because you think you're eating a Cheezel, then you get a biscuit aftertaste. I'm going to give them a 7 out of 10, they are good, but I think Cheezels should stay in their lane, because I'm a bit confused, we're all a bit confused here.
