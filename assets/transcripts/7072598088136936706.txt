Righto, so I've been crook all day and the only source of food in the house was the Russ Eats review food and I've made me way, I've done two tubes of Pringles and a pack of lollies and I'm about to move on to these and the peddles kicked in so I thought I better fucking review them so here we go Beef Brisket Taco Doritos the second of the Mexican street food range let's hurry up and review them so I can fucking eat them. They smell and taste exactly like your normal, you know your mince fucking taco kit, you know your basic mince fucking taco, I'll show you. This, they taste exactly like if you just mulch these up, they're actually pretty good. That's what taco, that's what taco should taste like. It's not beef brisket taco, it's ground beef taco. I'm gonna give it a seven, seven and a half out of ten. They're actually pretty good, better than the other shit, not bad.
