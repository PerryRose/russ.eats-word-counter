Right-o, Remedy Kick, a healthier energy drink range. Now I know Remedy's nailed the sugar-free taste, so I'm actually keen to give these a go. Now, don't be sucked in by the bullshit when something says natural, because uranium, asbestos, lead, arsenic, magic mushies, opium, tobacco, they're all natural substances. You could argue that cocaine is derived from a natural substance. So, fortunately or unfortunately, depending who you are, none of that's on the can, because I've read it for you. Now I'm keen as to try this, because it reminds me of a combination of these two drinks. You've got the sugar-free V, which is a fucking treat. I used to hate sugar-free energy drinks, and I've been smashing these. And then V Pure, which is like a natural V. This Remedy Kick is like a combination of the both. Kick it off with lemon-lime. Now, I forgot to tell you this is made with kombucha, so you've really got to like that kombucha flavour. It's not too vinegary like other kombucha, and they have nailed the sugar-free taste. It's not up my alley, but I'm going to give this one probably a 6 out of 10. Blackberry. That one's pretty good. It has a lot less of that taste and a really pleasant blackberry flavour. I'm going to give that one a 7.5, not bad. Mango Pineapple. 5.5 out of 10, wasn't a huge fan of that one. Now, if you know these kind of drinks, I think you'll love it because it has caffeine. But if you're a filth bag that likes fucking full-sugar Vs, ciggies, probably have kidney stones, I don't know if it's good enough to convert you to the healthier alternative.
