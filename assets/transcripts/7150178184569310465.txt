Right-o, Jumpy's and Friends baked crackers. I'm really happy to see the Jumpy's brand expanding. They're one of the most underrated Australian snacks, a real zero-to-hero story. Originally Real McCoy owned them, they were only found in like Golo, The Reject Shop, Hot Dollar, all your cheap places. If you don't know what they are, by the way, they're little hollow kangaroos covered in this mad fake chicken salt flavoring. They also got other flavors, but chicken's the main one. Fucking awesome. You can still get the OG Jumpy's, even at Woolies and Coles now, which is good. And it's also good to see he's got some friends. Let's give him a go. So they come in five fun Australian animal shapes. I'm gonna let this filter choose which one. What? Okay, I don't know what that is. Let's go again. What do we got here? Oh, koala. I've got one of each, yeah. Where's the koala? There we go. Little koala. Let's go. There we go. Fuck, I'm adorable. Up front you get a lot of chicken flavoring, but as that goes you just get left with like the biscuit aftertaste, which I don't really like. They're very similar to the Dixie Drumstick, but nothing on the original Jumpy, so I'm gonna give them a six out of ten.
