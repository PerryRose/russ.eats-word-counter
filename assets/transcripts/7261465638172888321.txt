No, part six of the journey, we're coming towards the end. I'm a little sad to be honest, but I'm here to tell you is the official launch date for Billson's Vodka with Twister. I know originally I said mid-July, there's always some delays with things that are great. Remember Grand Theft Auto V? That was delayed fucking heaps, and it was fucking mad. Another example, my birth, 42 weeks, slight delay. I'm all right. August 12th, tell Siri to put it in your fucking calendar, the first and only time you can try Twister before it starts hitting stores. I'll be there too, Billson's is throwing a launch party. I haven't actually tried the final product myself, so this will be a first time testing for me too. I only tried the prototype, so fucking let's crack one together. The thing is, if you want to come have a drink with me, you've got to get tickets. We've got super limited tickets because we don't want to stampede the brewery. They are expecting this to be bigger than the Taylor Swift tickets or Splendor tickets when the lineup wasn't shit. So if you're keen on that, jump over to the Billson's page for more details. I'm not an event organizer, so I have no fucking idea except that they go on sale tomorrow at midday. And for you who can't make beach worth that are wondering when it will hit the shops, I just chose the flavor. I'm not the fucking logistics manager, so how about you ask them. I'm here towards the end of August, so if you see it before I see it, let me know. Otherwise, I'll let you know. You fucking know how that works? Cheers.
