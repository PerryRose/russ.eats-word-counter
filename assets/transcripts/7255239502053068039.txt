Righto, Mocha Mud Cake M&M's. There's a reason I'm so keen on these, and that's because there's two types of M&M releases, right? You've got what I call effortless releases, where they literally just add a flavour to the chocolate. These are alright, but these were absolute dogshit. Then you've got releases like these, where they actually put effort in and put shit inside the M&M. Chewy bit of brownie, crunchy honeycomb, crunchy caramel, chewy caramel, and all the ones you get overseas, little bits of pretzel, little bits of birthday cake. This new launch is one of these ones. And how do I know that? It's because they actually show shit in the middle, and they're a lot bigger. So let's get straight into this. Okay, exactly the same as the brownie M&M's. Crispy shell, the chocolate, and the chewy brownie in the centre, but the brownie is coffee flavoured. Now, there's one thing letting it down in my opinion. Now, I'm a bit of a coffee snob, but all coffee chocolate tastes like international fucking roast, and it's just office coffee. It tastes like office hotel coffee to me, and I can never fully get around that. So I'm giving it a seven and a half, but if you like the brownie M&M's, and you like that piss that they call coffee, I think you will fucking love it.
