Righto, the Stinker Awards of 2022, the shittest products to hit our shelves this year. Now, I just want to mention, I reviewed this bowel prep when I had to have a camera up the bum earlier in the year, and it didn't even make the list. That's how fucking shit these next few products are. And if you missed it, yesterday we did the top 10 best treats of the year, which we have immortalised on the RussFest Festival line-up t-shirt, the link's in my bio. Kicking it off with number six, the McCrispy McDonald's chicken. This was one of the saddest excuses of fried chicken I've ever had. It was somehow wet and dry at the same time, and just tasted like stuffing. It was fucked. Number five, the cheeseburger in a biscuit. These just tasted like pickle, and they're one of the most offensive biscuits I've ever tried. Number four, the Cola Spider Zoopa Doopa Milk. This cleared me out better than the fucking bowel prep, mind you. This was that shit that's been spotted on sale for 15 cents. That's how fucked this product was. Number three, the Hamcube Cheese Hundreds and Thousands Biscuit Pack. I thought this was a fucking joke. I could not believe it with my own eyes when I seen this in the fridge section. The worst part though, is it only come with one biscuit, and then they tried to say you weren't supposed to eat them together, even though it shows it clearly on the packet, stacking onto the fucking biscuit. Second worst product of the year, the Vegemite Chook. What a fucking disgrace to Australia this was. It was just a normal barbecue chook with Vegemite on the packaging. This made me sick. And the number one shittest product of 2022, Meltz Chips. Smegma on a chip, these were fucked.
