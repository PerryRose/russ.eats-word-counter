Righto, two new KitKat flavours, the Mint Cookies and Cream and Smooth Hazelnut. Now, anyone that knows me knows I like them chunky, so I don't get as excited when they do normal KitKat flavours, but let's get straight into it. Kicking it off with the Smooth Hazelnut, doesn't look to be a heap in there, now they're obviously going for a Nutella filled KitKat, and it just makes me wonder, imagine how much fucking better a Nutella filled Chunky would be than that pissy amount of fucking hazelnut. Anyway, let's go. Okay, there's actually a heap of hazelnut flavour for that pissy amount, but it's not Nutella, it's more like the Hazelnut Praline Roses, it's pretty good, 7 out of 10. Now let's move on to the Mint Cookies and Cream, but KitKat, I've got to ask you a question. What the fuck is with your obsession with mint, you had more mint flavours than extra chewing gum, this is just the last two years, Mint Aero, Tasmanian Mint, Mint Choc Chip Ice Cream, Mint Cookie Fudge, whatever the fuck that is, and now we've got Mint Cookies and Cream. Anyway, let's do it, fair bit of mint there, let's see how it stands up against the other mint flavours. Okay, that's very fucking minty, so if you like it like that cooling mint sensation, you'll love it. I don't think it's Mint Cookies and Cream, I reckon it's closer to the Mint Ice Cream than the Mint Ice Cream one was. It's a bit full on, I'm going to have to give that one a 5 out of 10.
