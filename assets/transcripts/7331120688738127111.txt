Righto, the Russ Easter Bun Hunt continues with the most anticipated, not just Easter Bun, but product ever. I've never been sent something more than this. Once again, my inbox was filled and I thought someone had fucking died. Now, I was confused on how I was going to attack this right, because it's a filled bun. I don't mind a filled bun, but this one kind of reminded me of a video I once seen. It was like with a cup and two girls, something like that. Anyway, I'm thinking it needs butter. You have to try it with butter, but it's filled, so maybe you don't need it. So we're doing it four ways. Hot with butter, cold with butter, cold with nothing, hot with nothing. Let's fucking go and have a look at how the butter fucking mixes with the Biscoff. Cold without butter, hot without butter. Okay, we're off to a pretty good start. Flavor-wise, it's a match made in heaven. Absolutely beautiful. But texture-wise, because there's no butter there to lubricate, it kind of does this. The Biscoff gets like stuck in your teeth, which is apparently what they did to this horse, Mr. Ed, to make him talk with fucking peanut butter, but it's not a pleasant feeling. Hot with butter, cold with butter. Okay, the butter's crucial. Not only does it provide an important source of lubrication, the saltiness works so fucking well. But, I know there's a lot of hype and I don't want to be the party pooper, it is so similar to just Biscoff on fucking bread. So for that, I'm giving it an 8 out of 10. It's fun, it's fucking delicious, but it is just overpriced Biscoff on bread, okay? It is.
