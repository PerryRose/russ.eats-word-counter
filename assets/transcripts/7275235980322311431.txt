Righto, Schnitz has reached out to me to deliver you guys some news, but firstly, I'm pretty genuine with who I work with, and Schnitz is my go-to snitty place. I know you're going to say, what about the pub for a snitty, I'm done with the pub for a snitty. When you factor in the pokies, ten schooners, keno and a few bucks in the chockie machine, that cheap snitty ends up costing you a thousand bucks. That's why I'm here to tell you about five buck snitties on Saturday the 9th of September at Schnitz. Yeah, back in my day, five bucks would get you some triple butter explosion at about five weekly rentals, but these days, five bucks won't even get you two litres of fuel or a pack of Red Rock Deli chips, but on the 9th of September, for five bucks, you can get this. Mine was free, though, because I'm hot and famous, and I just ripped in, didn't even use a knife and fork, and a little bit of a spoiler, I will be doing the hunt for the best chippies, and Schnitz chips are sports bet favourite to take it out. If you haven't tried these, you are missing out, they are top tier chippies.
