Righto, the new Mars and Bounty Secret Centre Biscuits. You know I'm a harsh critic when it comes to Bickies. Ex-biscuit engineer, a court to sunrise as a biscuit expert with King Kosh, and I've been eating them for about 29 years, so I know me way around a Bickie. Anyways, Mars entered the biscuit world through Maltesers. These were all right, even though they look like anal beads. I do wonder, though, what they're doing. This is their best brand, in my opinion. There used to be heaps of Pods flavours, now we've just got the three originals, and they need to fucking pull their head in and bring out a few more Pods. Who's with me? We'll kick it off with the Mars. Here's the price and where you can buy them. Let's do it. They're just an overpriced caramel crown. I give these a six, so I'm giving them a five. And the Bounty. I'm giving that a five as well. Nothing special about that. If you want a Bounty biscuit, get these. They're fucking mad.
