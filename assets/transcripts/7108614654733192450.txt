Righto, part three of the junk food graveyard. I know it's winter, but I'm going to do ice blocks. Starting with Sunny Boys, especially Glub Cola and Raz Raspberry Flavor. Now these are one of the most unique shaped ice blocks I've ever had. If you were given one of these as a kid, it was so fucking hard to bite that you would literally have it for hours. Next we've got Clipo Shots. Now these are on par with Steve Irwin as the number one thing I want back from my childhood. Little individual tiny little balls of ice block that you'd shake into your mouth like a pack of nerds. Speaking of Clipo, they had these Clipo Frosts that were like a cola sorbet and they were oh. I've got to give a shout out to the Slick Stick. If you were poor, you were a bit pov-o, you would have eaten a fuckload of Slick Sticks. You wouldn't have been having Clipo Shots. Last but not least, we've got Bugs with Gummy Bugs. These were innovative as fuck as a kid. Ice blocks and you bite through them and you get little cold gummies. They were incredible.
