Righto, I think I've just stumbled across gold. I might be the first to break the news about the fucking sequel to the chocolate churro turtle chips I found these in an Asian convenience store. I nearly shit my pants when I seen them. These haven't even been translated These are straight imports from overseas. I'm keen as fuck. Now if you miss the hype or you have a shit memory I've pinned my reviews to the other flavors at the top of my profile the two savory flavors But it was the chocolate churro flavor that fucking broke the internet. This sold out everywhere This is the first time since I think Vegemite Cadbury chocolate and the first release of caramilk that there's been a sellout Australia-wide incredible Let's give them a go sweet vanilla flavor the fucking packaging is full on and this turtles creeping me the fuck out Have a look at it. Anyway, let's go. They look the same as the other ones except obviously they're white You know the folded over chip look but this time they've got choc chips all over it looks awesome. Let's go They're mad a heap similar experience to the chocolate ones except they remind me less of cereal the chocolate ones with his fucking Cocoa pops checks in a bag. These are like a sweet vanilla up front exact same texture and everything Then you get little choc chips and like sugar crystals at the end really sweet fucking quite cute bit of a cute treat I don't know if treats can be cute But these are fucking cute if you like the chocolate ones give these a go all day up 8 out of 10 8 8 out of 10
