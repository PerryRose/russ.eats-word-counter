Righto, more Netflix-sponsored food, the Rebel Moon range of Smith's chips. If you don't know what this movie is, it's a sequel to Sailor Moon, where she turns 18 and starts to rebel, gets a bit naughty, and instead of fighting crime, she's fighting a ketamine addiction. We'll kick it off with the Double Crunch Spicy Chicken Skewers flavor first, let's go. Okay, I haven't had these for a while, but I do think they're different. I thought they were gonna be identical. I'm almost getting like a spicy satay skewer vibe, but I can't see peanuts in the ingredients, but seven and a half out of 10, I quite like them. Next, we've got the Cheese Bread flavor. Okay, they taste like these, but less pungent and more mild in cheese flavor, which is fucking mad. Seven and a half out of 10, but I do think they're better. And the Roast Beef Garlic and Herb. Okay, that has surprised me. I thought it was just gonna taste like barbecue like every other fucking Smith's release, but it is fucking Sunday roast, roast beef, garlic, heaps of herbs. I'm giving that a seven out of 10. Overall, this is a step forwards in Smith's releases, but they're nothing spectacular, okay?
