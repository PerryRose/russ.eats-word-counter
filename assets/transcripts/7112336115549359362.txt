Righto, so for the first time in Rust Eats history, I'm doing a re-review. We got the Curtis Staines Caramel Slice, I gave it a 9.8 out of 10, and I had a fuckload of comments saying the same two things. First thing was the biscuits tasted stale. Fuck me, must have got a bad batch, they felt damp. Just the crunchy biscuits would be a straight 9, but those stale ones were not it. The second comment was, I don't think it tastes like a caramel slice at all. So I'm going to go into a bit more detail about this. So I did some research, and these are the three Cadbury products that have biscuit pieces, and they're all exactly the same. I remember eating these, and they tasted like a stale rice bubble. So I'm going to show you what the biscuit pieces are. See, this isn't up close, they are exactly the same in both products. Now I dug one out, and it's almost like the caramel absorbs the biscuit, it just, see, it just flattens, there was no crunch at all. Secondly, it's not a caramel slice at all, it needed a base like a Twix. It was, what fucking caramel slice has cream all the way through it? So I'm going to admit, I got it wrong, and Curtis Stone also got it wrong. It's not a 9.8 out of 10. It's still fucking good, but if I wanted stale biscuit, I'd eat the last orange slice at the bottom of the fucking barrel. I'm going to give these a 6.5 out of 10. It's really good, but the stale bits, I got a good batch. The stale bits are a fucking turn off.
