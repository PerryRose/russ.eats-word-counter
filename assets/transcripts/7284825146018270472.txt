Righto, the latest trend, a shot of Fireball and a Kurtz Cream in soda, it's supposed to taste like a jam donut. I've been asked by so many people to do this and it's the long weekend, I'm feeling fucking cheeky, so I'm going to one-up it by putting a shot in the new red pub soda, Brookvale Union. Let's do it. I've taken into the shed because I spilled shit everywhere last time, we're mid-renovations by the way, and the boys have turned up and it's a bit fucking weird that it's watching. Found a few weekly rentals too, if anyone's looking for a fucking babe in the life of Brian, hit me up. Let's get straight into it. Doing 40ml in each, so it's going to be one standard drink, just the Kurtz, and then it's going to be two standard drinks with the other one, okay? Let's fucking do it. Strong one first. No, that doesn't taste like a fucking jam donut at all. And the one standard... Shut up, cunt. I'm fucking recording. Keep that one in there because you'll know I've already had a sip. That just tastes like cream and soda. That's fucking absolute bullshit. Don't bother. For the record, if you said I used too much cream and soda, I've also tried half the cream and soda and it's no better. It tastes pretty fucking average. I'm going to give that a 4 out of 10, it's actually not good.
