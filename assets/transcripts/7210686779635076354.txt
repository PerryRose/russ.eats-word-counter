Righto, another Vegemite collab, Vegemite Brownies. There's just no standards anymore for Vegemite. It's turned into a little slut and it's collaborating with anything it can get its skanky hands onto. Ever since Bega took over, they've just whored this fucking brand out. The worst part about this is I haven't eaten proper food in five days because I drank some dodgy tap water and I've just been fucking shitting non-stop for five days. This is going to be the first thing in my guts. Let's get into it. 80 grams of butter, two eggs. You fucking put them in the middle. It's just a packet brownie mix, so it's pretty fucking simple. You mix it together till you see a nice thick brown sludge, a thick brown sludge that I was very familiar with this week. Now, I was getting a weird smell. I don't know if it was Vegemite, but something was weird. Anyways, put it into the brownie tray, but I fucked up because it was just way too big. So I had to do some weird folding shit to halve the size of the tray. Put it in the oven for 34 minutes, pulled it out. And you know what? They were actually looking pretty good if you ask me, but they smelled a little weird. There it is. Let's do it. They're fucking shit. They taste like normal brownies, but you've cut them up with a knife from the sink that had Vegemite on it. Like a sus, almost off, salty aftertaste. It's faint, but it's shit. Pull your fucking head in, Vegemite. I'm sick of this publicity stunt shit. We're going to switch to Promite or Marmite or Dick Smith's Ozzimite if you don't fucking stop this shit. We're done.
