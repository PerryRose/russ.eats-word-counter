Alright, Rust Eats first, we're going on Macca's drive-thru to try the new Dairy Milk McFlurry. Let's go. And what can I have for you tonight? Hey, I had the online order of V for Velcro, P for pneumonia, 61. Um, for Russell? Yep, that's it. Can you drive on down to the second window for me? Awesome, thank you. Oh, legend. Thank you so much. Cheers. So it just looks like a crushed up flake with a little squirt of hot fudge, but I won't knock it till I've tried it. Let's go. No, the wooden spoon they give you now is fucking pathetic. It tastes like the doctors, like the tongue suppressor. You know, they say, ah, that's what it tastes like. And this is shit. You've already tried it. It's a soft serve with a flake and hot fudge. It's a fucking scam. It's already out. Don't bother. 4 out of 10. Go to Beadaholique.com for all of your beading supply needs!
