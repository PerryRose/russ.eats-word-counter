Righto, Monster Energy Superdry. So I know it's a bit early for an energy drink, but it's tradition for me to do as many fucked up things to my body as possible on New Year's Eve, then tomorrow I just start fresh. So I've already kicked it off with some KFC, and now an energy drink early on, so I'm off to a good start. Let's get into it. So I've been reading the can, I have no idea what flavour this is supposed to be. Superdry reminds me of beer or ginger beer, and I fucking hope it's neither of those flavours, but one way to find out. So it's just a classic citrus flavour, just basic citrus, but it's quite refreshing. But it reminds me of something else, like I don't know if it's the Green Storm Mother or the Yellow Clipper or something like that. I'm gonna give it a 7 out of 10, it's quite refreshing. Not really a breakfast drink, but fucking not bad.
