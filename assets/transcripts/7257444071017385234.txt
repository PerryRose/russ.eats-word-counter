Righto, Macca's two new dipping sauces, Wasabi Mayo and Outback BBQ Sauce. I fucking love Macca's dipping sauces, it's a shame they forget the fucking things 50% of the time. Anyways, these are to support the FIFA World Cup sauces of the world. I can only assume that these two flavours are around the Matildas and Australia. Outback BBQ to celebrate the Australian Outback. And the Wasabi to celebrate Lee Harding, one of our finest musicians. Also, a quick shoutout to my favourite Macca's sauces. The Ranch and Buffalo from back in the day were so good, but the Cajun recently, that's a top tier sauce. I fucking love this. Starting with the Wasabi Mayo. Fucking weird colour. I really like that. I'm gonna give it a 7 though, because it's missing that Wasabi burn. You know, that clear in your nose Wasabi burn. If you don't like Wasabi though, don't fucking bother. But if you do, a little bit of a treat. The Outback BBQ. That's a fucking good barbie sauce. The only way I can describe it is it tastes kind of homemade, like a barbie sauce from the markets. Herby, a bit smoky and a nice amount of spice. 8 out of 10. I don't mind that at all.
