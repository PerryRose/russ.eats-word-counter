Righto, Howlerhead and Cola, this is banana bourbon that sponsors the UFC or the UFC owns them, I forget which way it works. Anyway, Australia's the only country to get the pre-mix at 6% and 30 bucks. Now the word Howler does remind me of when Ron got the Howler for crashing his mum's car, because a very similar thing happened. I flogged mum's car. I had no insurance years ago and it cost us like 20 grand. I woke her up and said, Mum, I flogged your car and I fucking crashed it. And as we opened the door for me to show her the car, the fucking front of the commie literally fell off as we were looking at it. I'm sorry. I really am sorry, mum. Anyways, let's do it. And mum, I am sorry. One day I will buy you a new commie, okay? Or even better, a hybrid Camry, the sexiest car on earth. Let's go. I don't know. It's just like a normal bourbon and coke up front and then you get like a lolly banana aftertaste, but only a very slight hint. I don't mind it. I'm probably just going to give it a six and a half. I wish it was stronger banana. And I do think a banana coke could work. That hint is a bit of a treat. I just want more of it. Is it worth 30 bucks? I don't know. I'm not your fucking accountant, but it's alright. I will try the straight stuff though. I think that'll be better. The coke's just masking all the flavour.
