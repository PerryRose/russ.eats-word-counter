Righto, Padlova Billsons, this is not eligible for festive piss, okay, because it's the only can I'll have this year. It's an advent calendar exclusive. Also, apologies about my voice, I went to Good Things Festival yesterday, I'm absolutely, I'm pretty fucking rough today. And listen to this, three and a half songs into the headlining set for that boy, they fucking turned off the music and said there's a storm coming, everyone's gotta leave. But they didn't open any emergency exits up, so people were pushing fucking fences down. It took 30 minutes to get out of the festival. It was an emergency, if you couldn't keep playing, then that's a fucking emergency in my opinion. Anyway, we then finally got out the front, and the biggest storm I've ever been in, fucking lightning everywhere, I had the worst chafing of my fucking life and had to walk 30 minutes. I literally got swept off my feet, there was that much water coming down the streets. Now you can get absolutely fucked, fuck you, fuck all that boy too, you cunt. Sorry, I went on a little bit of a rant, I forgot I'm reviewing piss, let's go. Okay, they've obviously used the exact same meringue flavouring as the lemon meringue. You get like passion fruit and creaming soda up front, and then you get that meringue flavouring, and maybe a very slight base flavour. I actually wish they would bring this out as a proper flavour, because I get two of these and two lemon meringues as a little bit of a fun, dessert festive piss conversation starter. So I'm a little bit disappointed that they're not actually releasing this one. That's six and a half.
