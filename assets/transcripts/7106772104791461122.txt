Righto, Cheese and Pickles Limited Edition Smith's Chips. So if you haven't seen, these Smith's flavours are a part of a very limited edition drop at Aldi out of all places. So something to do with all this British shit. I'm assuming it's for the Queen's birthday and I'm glad they're doing it because she's probably only got about one fucking birthday left in her. Let's do it. Potatoey smell. That's not what I expected at all. So I was expecting something like this, something with a real pickle-y twang about it. So they just taste like cheese and onion chips but with a little slight pickle aftertaste. So I'm only going to give them a 6 out of 10. They're nice but they're not as strong of a pickle as I expected them to be.
