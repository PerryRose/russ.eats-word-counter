Righto, Mr. Beast's Feastables Chocolate, another product just like Prime, made by a YouTuber, and kids go wild over it, so people are selling it online for like 20 bucks a block. And of course, just like Prime, Woolworths have jumped on the bandwagon, because they love making a quick buck out of us, the fucking price gouging fucking cunts. Anyway, have a look at this. I know it's backwards, but it's only 60 grams for 4 bucks, where a normal block is 5 bucks 50 for 180 grams, so they know what they're doing, scamming us as usual. Now I'm assuming you know who Mr. Beast is, and I'm kinda jealous, but if I was in his shoes, the challenges I'd do to give away money would be so much more fucked up, I couldn't help myself. I'd be like Fear Factor, or making people lick a white dog poo like Step Brothers, shit like that. Or, you know when you're at the pub and two people are having a hypothetical argument like, would you do blah blah blah, like something fucked up for a million dollars? If I was him, I'd just be there in the background whipping it out, and actually making people do that shit. We'll kick it off with the original chocolate. Okay, that surprised me, it's kind of like this, but obviously this is better, so I'm gonna give it a 6.5 out of 10, not bad. The milk chocolate, 5 out of 10, it's okay, it's quite creamy, but it tastes like a middle class easter egg. The Deez Nuts, which is peanut butter filled, starts to aftertaste super salty, I don't know if it's the peanut or if it's nut sack, I think it's nut sack. And the crunch block, it's okay, but why the fuck would you buy it when you get 170 grams of this shit, the top tier shit for 5 dollars 50. I'm gonna give it a 3 purely for that reason.
