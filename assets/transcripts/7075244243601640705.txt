Right-o. Sour Skittles Giants. Three times bigger and softer inside. So I found these dumped in the dairy milk with all the blocks and I could not find where they were. So apparently they're in Coles. I just don't know where because they were not in the Lolly Isle when I looked. So anyway, if you don't remember, have a look at this. This is what Sour Skittles used to look like. They had heaps of tangy, twangy shit on the outside. They used to cut your mouth up, but they were fun. They were fucking awesome and they took it away. They took away all the sour stuff and now they're just a slightly tangier Skittle. So I've been off the Sour Skittles bandwagon for a long time, but these new ones look exciting. So I'm going to give them a shot. Right-o. So if you have a look, they're about the size of a Mentos. I've had one of each flavor. They don't taste like a Skittle. They're not a Skittle. They're like a Mentos, more like a lolly. It tastes like they should be bubblegum and they're not very sour. So disappointing. 5 out of 10. They're alright, but they're not sour and they're not a Skittle.
