Righto, the new Vanilla Passion Fruit Slices block. I am keen as fuck on this. Vanilla Passion Fruit is an awesome combo. The tang and the sweet. Passion Fruit Slice is awesome, and the Pawn Star Martini, which is Vanilla Passion Fruit, is my favourite cocktail. This was my second choice for what my Billson's flavour was going to be, by the way. Quick unboxing. Vanilla cream in a Passion Fruit jelly. A real nice, fresh Passion Fruit smell. Also, when Foxtel first started, there was no ads, and now there's heaps of ads. I'm exactly the same. This choppy chop's brought to you by Prepared Knives. I'm a fucking sellout. Discount code BIGQUEEF. BIGFUCKINGQUEEF52. Get that up ya. Let's do it. Also, there is no BIGQUEEF discount code. That wasn't an ad. They are me trusty knives. They're good knives, but I haven't sold out yet. I might one day. If the fucking kids need feeding, the kids need feeding. Anyway. Yeah, I fucking love that. I am a bit biased, obviously, because I just told you how much I love Vanilla Passion Fruit. It's giving me snack vibes, but maybe a little bit sweeter. You get that fucking gooey Passion Fruit up front. That's just like the top of a Passion Fruit slice, and then a real sweet chocolate vanilla aftertaste. Absolutely love it. 9 out of 10.
