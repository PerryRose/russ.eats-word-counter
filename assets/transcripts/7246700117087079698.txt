Righto, I know a few of us get annoyed that I only ever do Macca's and KFC and I always leave Hungo's and fucking Red Rooster out, so I'm doing it. The new Grillmasters Pulled Pork Angus. Firstly, I want to mention the Grillmasters range shits all over the Macca's Angus range in my opinion. This Chicago Angus is a fucking treat. Also wanted to mention, the reason I didn't want to do this is it does not look appetising at all. That looks like fucking John West's tuna. Quick unboxing, the cardboard was greasy as fuck, but it was quite nicely packaged on the inside if you ask me. But the burger itself does look a little bit sad. Let's do it. Also, that's some of the pork by itself. It does look a bit like tuna, and this burger was $12.85 by itself. That's pretty fucking crazy. Anyway. Oh, fuck. Okay, so the pulled pork's supposed to be the highlight of this burger, but it's the worst fucking bit. It actually has the texture of tuna. I'm giving that a 4 out of 10 with the pulled pork, but without it, it would be an 8 out of 10. It's got mustard and mayo, not a bad beef patty, and it was actually pretty fucking fresh. It would be an 8 out of 10 without the pulled pork. Nothing like the rest of the range. Don't bother with this one. Go to Chicago.
