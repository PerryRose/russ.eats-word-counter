Righto, cookie dough M&Ms, still a campin' addition. This is the longest I've ever lasted campin'. I'm usually not a good camper. The negatives have been, I've run out of undies, so I'm on the third rotation of these fuckin' pair, but anyway. And the positives, I've seen Jerbo, Jake Turbo, is gettin' around this campsite, so if you see this, Jerbo, come have a fuckin' beer. Let's go. They're a decent size, about a peanut M&M size. That's what the inside looks like, a decent bit of cookie dough, but this is the last thing I should be puttin' in my gut, so I've had nothin' but low-fiber food and beers for fuckin' five days. They're all right, I think they're gonna get sickening. I've already had a few, and I'm like, nah, not gonna do about more than 10 of these, so I'm gonna give them a seven out of 10 purely on that, but if you love cookie dough, I reckon you won't mind it.
