Righto, the orange Toblerone. No one can find the fucking gold one so they're telling me to give this a go because they can find this, and it's only six bucks at Woolies, and we'll be giving the correct way to break apart the Toblerone a go. Everyone's been commenting how do you break it apart, been doing some research, so apparently I'm doing it wrong. Okay so the way I do it is I break it like this, but apparently you're supposed to do this. That's fucking shit. That's fucking absolutely stupid. That was a fucking waste of time. It's like those videos that are like, you have been eating bananas wrong your whole life. I'll eat a banana however the fuck I want. Don't listen to those videos, just eat your Toblerone, you'll be half pissed on Christmas anyway. Anyway, I've noticed this is nougat and gingery candied orange peel through the Toblerone, so normal Toblerone with that, not orange flavoured. Anyway, let's give it a go. That's not bad. That's a mature treat. It's subtle. It's only a little bit of real orange flavour, not like the full on fake Jaffa flavour. I spat everywhere. That's pretty fucking good. I'll probably give that a seven and a half out of ten. If you like orange, this is probably your Christmas treat.
