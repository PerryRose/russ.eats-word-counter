Righto, Vegemite Harvest Snaps Baked Pea Crisps. So if you haven't tried this range, just take my word on it, they're fucking awesome. They're the next gen of snacks, they're kind of, in my opinion, the next grain waves. So when I seen Vegemite flavour, I was pretty fucking keen, because the history of veggie flavours has been pretty good. We've had Vegemite Smiths, Vegemite in a biscuit, Vegemite Shapes, obviously. We've had the Vegemite Chocolate, which I like, to be honest. And most recently, Vegemite Baked Beans. I didn't bother with these, because I would have fucking farted so fucking much. Let's go. They smell Vegemite-y, but a bit weird. Hang on. They fucking taste like burnt toast. Oh shit, not burnt, Vegemite toast. I kind of like burnt toast, so I'm going to give them a 5 out of 10, but they're pretty dry, they've got nothing on the other flavours.
