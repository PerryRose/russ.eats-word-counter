Righto, the junk food graveyard. We're gonna pay our respects to some of the fallen snacks over the years. Starting with Incredibites. These were fucking awesome. I freaked out when I seen these. I forgot all about them. They're little pillows full of chocolate. You only got these if you were rich or I only got them when mum got up on the pokies because these were an absolute fucking treat. Then we've got these little M&M biscuits. They were fucking awesome. No wonder we're fat. There was nothing of nutrition in these and they came in four flavors. M&M, Twix, Milky Way and Mars and they were all just as good as each other. Then a simple sandwich wasn't good enough for our generation so they brought out these snackabouts. So it was Vegemite, cheese and peanut butter, little biscuits with them and you'd fucking lick out the pack at the end like a filthy boy and you'd chew the fuck out of this stick for the rest of the day. These were awesome. An honorable mention to space food sticks. These had the texture of Blu Tack but for some reason they were fucking awesome and there was nothing else like them.
