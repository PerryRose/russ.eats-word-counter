Righto, probably my most anticipated review ever. I'm actually a bit sad. This is the end of the journey, the final wrap-up. But, I only chose the flavour, I didn't fucking make it, so I'm gonna tell you my true thoughts. Let's do it. So this actually launches everywhere next week, and I'd be lying if I'm saying I haven't tried it yet. I've had about fucking 50 of these bastards, and at the launch party, sorry to Session 4, I was absolutely blind. Let's do it. Okay, I'm gonna give you guys the fucking truth, and I've had plenty of feedback to back this up. This is probably the easiest drink I've ever drank in my life. I got through 10 of them on the day. It's not as sweet as other Bilsons, super easy to drink, they have fucking nailed the flavour. It is a melted cyclone. If you get it out of the freezer where it just starts to freeze, it is probably the best drink I've ever had in my life. And I'm telling you the fucking truth. I'm giving that a 10 out of fucking 10. I know you're gonna say I'm a fucking bias, I'm a sellout, whatever. That's the truth. Take it or leave it.
