Right, I'm finally getting around to it. Troy Candy's G up vodka. So this is a no sugar and low sugar 4.6% Basically a vodka cruiser and it has electrolytes now Electrolytes are supposed to make you feel a bit better the next day. It does work I have done vodka powerades and a couple of vodka metamucils to get me good for the next day But if you're sucking on a cerveau vape a fucking kiwi quaver and you're two fingers deep in a late-night kebab Electrolytes are not gonna fucking save you. I promise you that. We'll start with cotton candy This is the only one with no sugar 7 out of 10 not bad for a sugar-free drink It definitely does have the aftertaste but doesn't hang around for as long that makes sense The positive is the cotton candy flavor is pretty fucking good. Usually fairy floss shit is way too sweet That's got a good sweetness level now the raspberry Fuck me I can't believe what a little bit of sugar does that is so much fucking better the sugar free is not bad But compared to that I'm dropping that to a 6 and giving that a 9 out of 10 It has about half the sugar of a cruiser, but it's a fucking treat That's like a melted red super duper melted red slushy fucking mad now the grape Eight and a half out of ten it tastes like a carbonated grape Maximus overall The range is super easy to drink because it's not too sweet if that makes sense So if that's up your alley, I reckon you'll like it. I can't believe it's cool to drink this shit now I would have got fucking glassed if I was caught drinking this when I was fucking 18 If you drink this stuff and you're 18 think yourself lucky
