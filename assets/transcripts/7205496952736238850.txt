Righto, part two of the Russ Eats Billson's flavour journey, behind me we've got my short list. One being most likely to be my flavour, to seven being least likely. Now, I'm going to comment each of these flavours in the comments. I want you to like one, two, three, if you're feeling cheeky, of ones you'd be happy with. But at the end of the day, I'm a selfish bastard, so I'm going to choose whatever the fuck I want, and who knows, it might even be one of these. Let's get into it. After Cyclone, we dove straight into Red Frogs, where Gus and Casey even celebrated because they fucking nailed it second go. This was spot on, but too similar just to being normal Red Cordial, that I won't be choosing it for that exact reason. Not different enough. After that, Vanilla Passion Fruit, inspired by the Pornstar Martini, but also inspired by a hungover piss. I had to check there was no kidney stones in this toxic fucker. I even found some in the Macca's urinal, where I also got inspiration for the Woolies Mudcake flavour over here. Now, I've never tried a fucking soft drink like this. It was absolutely gorgeous. It worked so well, the sweet and the tang. It's equal first, by the way. After that, I was running out of ideas, so I just fucking closed my eyes and dug into this pile of flavours, where I got Cream, which paired perfectly with Earl Grey Tea. So if you love a breakfast Billy, this one might be for you. After that, Tattoo Bubblegum, inspired by these fucking bubblegums with the little temporary tattoos. Each can will come with its own temporary tattoo. There's mine. Now, I tried this. Spot on, but super, super fucking sweet, but more like a cute sweet, like something that a fucking Powerpuff Girl or Belle Delphine would drink. Pretty fucking good. Overall, this is my list. Let me know in the comments. Forgot to record Kablooey and Musk, but I assure you, they were a little fucking treat.
