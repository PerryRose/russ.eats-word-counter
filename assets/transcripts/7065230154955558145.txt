Righto, pretty excited about this. Finally a little bit of innovation in the chip aisle. We have melts which are potato chips drizzled with creamy cheese layers. So finally they've given us what we want and that's something a bit unhealthier and not pumping veggies into the chips like fucking everyone else is doing and no one wants that. No one wants veggies in chips. Potatoes are veggie and that'll do. Anyway let's give it a go. Righto, quick look there's actual wet melted cheese on it which is fucking weird. It's all over and they're just stuck together. It's very, I've never seen anything like this. Look at that, that's stuck to it. I'm keen to try these. Right, stop. That's fucked. That's smegma. That is smegma on a chip. They are fucked. I'm giving them, that two out of, smegma on a chip is pretty bad. That's two out of ten. Don't eat that. Rub a chip on your dick instead.
