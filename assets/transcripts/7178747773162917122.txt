Right-o, Snackology, The Study of Snacks, Episode 4. What the fuck's a moro? Now this gets asked all the time. What's a moro and why is it in my Cadbury favourites? Now obviously a moro is Cadbury's ripoff of a Mars bar, but we don't even see the big version of the moro So how does it end up in the greatest hits of Cadbury? Now I originally thought maybe moro is like the bonus track of a best-of. Like back in the day they'd always sneak an unreleased track onto your greatest hits. Bless my soul, Fortune Faded, Another Girl, Another Planet, Pop Rocks and Coke. You get it. But no, I was wrong. The moro is a big deal, just not in Australia. In Australia the Mars bar dominates. This fucking Cadbury ripoff doesn't even get time of day to be a big one on our shelves. But in New Zealand the moro is huge. It outsells the Mars bar. Now this blows my mind because in Australia we fucking hate the moro because we hate anything that we're not familiar with. But in New Zealand the brand name of the moro is that big that they don't have Boost Bar. They have Moro Gold. So anything that's Boost over here is Moro Gold over there. What the fuck? Now to make it even more confusing, a Moro Gold or a Boost is just a normal moro in Ireland which confuses the fuck out of them when they're traveling. So what's a moro? A moro is kind of like Rugby Union. In Australia, we don't really give a fuck about it but about once a year we'll give it a run. In New Zealand though, it is huge. It is a national treasure. So should it be in our favourites box? I'm only going to go with yes because it is a bit of a treat and if Dream is in the favourites box then surely the moro gets a run.
