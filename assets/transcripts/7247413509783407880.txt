Aussie lolly, Ellens, has announced Fantails will be discontinued for good after a major decline in sales. Despite being a staple in Australian households for 93 years, Fantails will come to an end when stock runs out in July. For more, we're joined by food reviewer Russell Stewart, better known as Russ Eats Online. Russ, what do you make of this? Righto, good morning. Hello. What do you think? I'm sad. I took the day off. I'm grieving. I'm also a bit confused, to be honest, as to why they chose Fantails over, like, I was at the shops yesterday and Freckles, Jaffers, I feel like they're down here. Fantails was like the lord of Ellens lollies. Right, so they're the loser lollies, so Fantails should be up there, should they? They're at the top. Well, Ellens had Cobbers and they got rid of them, which were kind of like Fantails, and now they've gotten rid of them, so I don't know why they've killed two of the same lolly. You don't reckon it's a publicity stunt, do you? Well, they released it, which is a bit odd. Usually someone like me will find out through a worker and then we'll, like, leak it, but they said it, which is a bit odd. So maybe it's like, oh, we're getting rid of it if you don't buy more. And it's worked. Empty boxes. I got the last three packs, I went to four Woolies and Coles, empty boxes everywhere because people just, like, flocked to the shops to get the last Fantails. Russ, what do you like about the Fantail? Well, it's, um, I was saying it's the death of another printed media, actually, because of the trivia on the Fantail, and I was even, I was even doing the little, I was even ripping the little chain, you know, I used to have a record, I hold the world record for longest Fantail chain, two kilometres. Um, but yeah, it's a little bit of fun compared to the Minties that have that stupid little, what's it called? What little, little cartoon on it, and no one even likes Minties, yet they've kept them, they've kept Milko's, Shirby's, I'm, I just couldn't believe it. I know, it was the earliest Google, wasn't it, for a lot of us, before that was even invented. It is a sad day. Um, let's hope it is a publicity stunt and they're wrong. Well, maybe Google killed the Fantail. Oh my goodness, I think Russ, you're right, thank you, on this sad day in lolly history in Australia. Here, Shelby. Oh, Russ is old school with his silver chair top as well. Still ahead this morning, your complete guide to Taylor Swift's Aussie tour. We're live to T.
