Righto, Russ Eats First, Hangover Edition, Barocca, Mango and Orange. So context is important with reviews like this, so here's the story. Here's me at 3am with a kebab, garlic and sweet chilli with the lot, fucking chuffed on top of the world. Look at that little cheeky grin. Then here's pretty much me when I woke up about three hours later, like a fucking dried up sultana and I was like reaching for the fridge like the fucking conjuring and out I got the frostiest blue Gatorade that has done me wonders. So always have a frosty Gatorade in the fridge because it's fucking, I'm alright, I'm alright. Fast forward to now, 11am and I've got myself a Barocca, so I'll do the crack, he drops the little tablet down, I'll let it dissolve and let's give it a go. It's no blue Gatorade but it's the best of the Baroccas, 5.5 out of 10 for your hangover drinks, it's alright.
