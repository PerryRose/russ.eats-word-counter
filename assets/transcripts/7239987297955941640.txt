Righto, it's a Friday and you know I like a little bit of piss. We've got the new Billson's Ginger and Lime flavour, which is a bit of a tamer release, a bit of a missionary release compared to their other shit like Great Bubblegum and My Titty Twister coming out. Then we've got the new Billson's Ginger Beer, which I thought was exclusive to their factory, but you can actually get it at Dan Murphy's now. In the alcohol world, there seems to be more and more ginger things. It's one of the only sweet drinks that I can drink about Adolph without feeling sick. I fucking love ginger. For the record, here's some of my favourite gingers. And here are my least favourite gingers, especially Randall. He's a little fucking dweeb. We'll kick it off with the Ginger and Lime. Okay, it's pretty good. It's not like a ginger beer. It doesn't have that ginger spice. It is really like a pre-mixed cordial ginger. But what it's missing is some of this shit, bitters. This Ginger Lime and Bitters was my favourite drink ever and then they took it away. If you add a couple of drops of this to that Ginger and Lime, it brings it up to a fucking nine out of ten. And the classic ginge. Okay, that's smack bang in the centre of the scale of ginge. You've got your super sweet shit up this end, like that, like the Ginger and Lime. Then up this end you've got your super spicy fucking brewed ginger beers that like grandad's drink. This one's straight in the middle. It's a little bit less spicy and sweeter than your Brookvale Union and your Brown Snake. And a little bit more ginge, a little bit more ginge than your Kirk's Ginger Beer, if that makes sense. I like it. I'm going to give that an eight and a half out of ten.
