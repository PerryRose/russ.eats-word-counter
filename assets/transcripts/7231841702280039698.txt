Righto, the Sandboy Max Range, 50% more flavour, but there's two things that are going to piss you off. The first one is there's no salt and vinegar. Apparently it was too intense, but if you ask me, I want salt and vinegar so strong that your mouth bleeds. I want to cough blood after having salt and vinegar. They're too weak these days. By the way, remember these Flavour Bomb Sandboys, you've got to actually add how much salt and vinegar you wanted to your packet with an extra sachet. Incredible. The second and main thing that will piss you off is apparently they're exclusive to Drake's Supermarkets Only, which is in South Australia. I had to get these posted to me by an employee. Well, I hope they turn up elsewhere, but I'll let you know if they're worth even hunting. Kicking it off with chicken now. It doesn't look like it, but I assure you, there is a fair bit of fucking dust on these. I'm shocked. I don't usually rate chicken chips, but all they're missing was more flavouring. They are absolutely gorgeous. It's like intense Maggi chicken noodle seasoning. I'm giving them an eight and a half out of 10, but compared to other chicken chips, they're a 10. Time for barbecue. Check out the fucking dust on that. Wow. Okay. If you love barbecue chips, you're either going to think they're the best thing in the world or a bit too much. I personally think it's a bit too much. Not as good as the chicken. Seven out of 10. They probably only need 25% more flavour. Save me favourite for last, atomic tomato. The 10. Holy fuck, mate. That takes atomic tomato to the next fucking level. That is a nine and a half out of 10 chip and I'm a bit biased, so fuck me.
