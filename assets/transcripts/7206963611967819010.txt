Righto, the junk food graveyard part 12. We're going to continue on with Macca's. I've also pinned the first Macca's junk food graveyard to the top of my profile. To kick it off, we're going all the way back to the early 2000s, the time of the Subway diet. Subway was huge and to compete, Macca's did the deli choices. Now these were fucking surprisingly good. The bacon egg was absolutely gorgeous, but the Italian Supreme fucking hit the spot. If you don't remember them, this photo should jog your memory, because this is how I remember them. Years later, they did a schnitzel range, the M selections, which I thought were going to be like the deli rolls, but I just remember these being super fucking dry. Then we've got Create Your Taste. This was about 10 years ago, when there was a burger shop popping up every second week, and grilled was at its absolute peak. This is where Macca's installed the kiosk for the first time, and you could customize the fuck out of your own burger. They served them up to you on a piece of timber with the chips in a basket. Now these were fucking yum, but the thing was, they were expensive and took ages. We went to Macca's to get cheap shit, filthy fast food. If we wanted burgers like this, we'd go to one of the fucking burger shops that were popping up every second week. Speaking of cheap, filthy fast food, the McDouble saved my life. It got me through uni. This is the same as a double cheeseburger, missing a bit of cheese, but it was two bucks. For eight bucks, I get two McDoubles and two chicken and mayos. That's dinner. And these were breakfast. These also saved my life. And finally, we've got the original Angus launch. These were different on launch. They had like a damper bun. They were so much better. Here's another photo that should re-jog your memory. These were tough. Fuck me, they were good.
