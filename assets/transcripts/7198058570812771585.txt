Right-o, special burger sauce hot cross buns. I don't have to tell you how fucking dumb this sounds. This is offensive to Easter. There's people out there that want Jesus to come back. If they keep bringing shit like this out, he's not coming back. But, the reason it makes me so sick is that burger sauce is mayonnaise-based, basically, and this is like mayo in a shelf-stable bun, which just sounds absolutely fucked. Let's get into it. Okay, I actually gagged when I opened the packet. Words can't describe how pungent this smells, and it looks fucked. Look, hard burger sauce around the outside, and then a little dried pickle. Looks like a meat the fucker's foreskin. I am not keen on this. Let's go. Oh, fuck. I have to spit that out. That is one of the most fucked things I've ever put in my mouth. It's like a moldy old bread roll with a sour taste, with dried bits of hard pickle through it. That is absolutely fucked. That is a zero out of ten. Do not bother. I hope this is a publicity stunt. That has made- that has made me crook. Crook in the fucking guts. Is it off?
