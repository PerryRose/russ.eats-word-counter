Righto, it's not too often you hear someone say that they love finding new lumps, but here we are. Boysenberry Pascal lumps and Feijoa lumps, which are available only in New Zealand. So if you don't know about lumps, pineapple lumps are some of the OGs, they are a New Zealand delicacy and also one of my childhood favourites. Recently they did Perkinana lumps, they were fucking awesome, they've also done peach lumps and snifters lumps over here in Australia. Starting with boysenberry, now if you haven't had pineapple lumps before, they're chocolate coated and there's nothing else like them, it's one of the most unique chewy lolly fillings you'll ever have. I'll show you. Look. Chewy as fuck. Give us a sec. So you either love them or you hate them, I fucking love them. All the chocolate melts and then you're left with this chewy, mild, tangy boysenberry lolly. I have to give them a 7.5 out of 10, but some people hate them. Now let's try the Feijoa. By the way, a Feijoa is a South American fruit that apparently tastes like guava, pineapple and strawberry, which sounds mad. Let's go. Nah, that does not taste anything like that. It tastes like perfume at the end. Thank you to the bloke that sent these, I forgot your name, I was trying to find you in the DMs, but they are pretty shit, but I do appreciate it. I'm giving them a 4 out of 10.
