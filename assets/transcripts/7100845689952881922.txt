Righto, it's not too often there's a scandal in the junk food world, but Maxibond has done us the dirty, so I'm going to deliver you the news before Tracy Grimshaw does. Two months ago, these signs were up all over 7-Eleven. I've been popping in on the way home from work trying to get one of these little waffle on Maxibonds, and then the other day, I find a sticker over it with Violet Crumble Gold and Gay Time is back. First of all, $5.50 for a Gay Time can get fucked, but I actually hit them up. Best sells a new waffle one, thank you, it's currently unavailable. I was like, bullshit, here's the sign, and then they start ignoring me, so I hit them up and they say, sorry for the confusion, currently working with the 7-Eleven team, yada, yada, yada. Worst bit is that they've completely ignored my request for a Blue Waffle flavor. If you haven't had a Blue Waffle, give it a Google, very yummy. Anyways, Maxibond, I'm not going to boycott you, but if you don't make up for this mistake, remind.
