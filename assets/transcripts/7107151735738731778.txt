Righto, second in the Aldi exclusive British drop, we have Prawn Cocktail Smiths. Start with a sniff. Ooh. Okay, not fishy at all, that's odd. It's kind of barbeque-y, weirdly. Let's go. Ooh, a little aftertang. This has more tang than the fucking pickled ones. Give us a sec. So they're really fucking good. So I thought they were going to taste like prawn. I was actually expecting them to be like fucking fanny, a full fanny chip. You know what they taste like? They taste like atomic tomato when you're first chewing them and then like a salt and vinegar aftertaste. They're nothing like a prawn cocktail, there's no fish about them at all, but they are really good. I'm going to give them an 8.5 out of 10 because I am fucking shocked.
