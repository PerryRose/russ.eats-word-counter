Righto, the new M&M's, cookies and cream flavoured. Cookies and Scream actually, they're for Halloween. I don't like scary movies, and I don't really know about scary treats, but let's give them a go. So they're typical Halloween colours. There's the cookies, I just don't know where the Scream is. Let's give them a go. They are piss weak, honestly. There's been no effort put into these. I was expecting like a little bit of Oreo in the middle, I should have looked at the packet. It's just cookies and cream flavouring, which I can't fucking taste by the way. They're just like a normal M&M, and they're not scary at all. Five out of ten, don't fucking bother.
