Righto, some sick twisted bastard made this fake photo and fooled us all. I got that excited that I've decided I'm going to make it myself with the first time ever Russ Eats Creations. I started with a silicone mold making kit, which I dropped a KitKat Chunky into. Now this mold actually turned out pretty good. Then I got three ingredients, chocolate, bueno and wafer. For the bueno filling, the milk and hazelnut, I actually used the Happy Hippos as it had the same filling but a lot more. These are fucking awesome by the way if you haven't tried them. Got four of them, cut the bastard in half and scraped the guts out. Threw it into a bowl, mixed it up for a nice and even consistency. Next bit was simple. Chocolate, melted chocolate. Piped it into the mold, then I piped the bueno filling. Then chucked a wafer on top, filled the rest up with chocolate in the fridge and this is where it went to shit. You've got the KitKat logo but it's fucked up. It's mangled. Cut the guts. So it does look like a KitKat Chunky. I'm pretty happy with that. It doesn't look good but does it taste good? Oh, fuck em. Oh, fuck em. I'm a genius. That's a 9.5 out of 10, exactly like a KitKat Chunky. Bueno taste. Yes, it cost me $60 in materials to make including the silicone mold but it was fucking worth it.
