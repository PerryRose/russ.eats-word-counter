Righto, the Taylor Swift Smirnoff Ice. I know what you're thinking, where the fuck does it say Taylor Swift on the bottle? The answer is, it doesn't. This review is clickbait, just like this fucking article. I thought it was weird, this got me by the way, I thought it was weird. I didn't think Taylor Swift would do alcohol. Most of her audience is kids, and she looks like the kind of person that gets pissed off two cruisers. And it's like the fucking Wiggles doing a fruit salad flavoured vodka cruiser. Seriously, look at all these articles. I don't know if it was Smirnoff that did this, or they just jumped on the Swift bandwagon, but apparently because it's lavender flavour, that has something to do with Taylor Swift. Anyways, let's do it. I feel like it's going to taste like Potpourri and lemonade. Also, Potpourri reminds me, when I was young, I found a massive plastic bag of bush weed. And I said to mum, mum, I think I found drugs in the walk-in wardrobe. And I described it to her, and she said, no, no, no, that's Apple Potpourri, dried apples and stuff. And then I said, well, mum, I've thrown it out, I thought it was drugs. And I've never seen my mum run so fast to the fucking whiz bin in my life. Also, I was about to do the sip, but then realised it's half empty, because I've already recorded this review, but I had a bit of fluff stuck to my chin the whole time, so I had to fucking re-record it. Oh, we can pretend. Nah, 5 out of 10. Just tastes like a normal Smirnoff ice, but with like a bitter, almost flower aftertaste. Complete catfish. But you're not going to listen to me. You're a fucking idiot, and you think it's got to do with Taylor Swift, so you're probably going to buy it anyway.
