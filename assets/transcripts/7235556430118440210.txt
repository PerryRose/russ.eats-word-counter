Righto, the new Crunchy Almond Toblerone. Now, I know that sounds boring, but it is salted caramelised almonds. And that excites me because I absolutely love these. You know at the markets, there are these hot nuts that are like salted, honey roasted. They come in a little paper bag. I'm hoping that it's these mixed through this. And by the way, the packaging is absolutely gorgeous. Now, this flavour has been overseas for ages, but we don't get everything here in Australia. Now, I've mentioned these before, but some other flavours we've missed out on are the corn and the corn flavoured Toblerones. Here we go. There's the middle of it. It's absolutely packed. It kind of tastes like a normal Toblerone, but with these sugary, salty almonds in the aftertaste that make you want more. It's like an enhanced Toblerone, if that makes sense. Well, I think Toblerone is a seven and a half, so I'm gonna give these an eight and a half out of 10. It's like a better Toblerone.
