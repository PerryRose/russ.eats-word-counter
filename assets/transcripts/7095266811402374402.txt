Righto, the shittest products to hit the shelves, part two. We're going to start with this popcorn. I can't believe they're still selling it. This is the most stale, shit-tasting fucking popcorn I've ever had. If someone ripped a bag of this open at a party, you just knew it was going to be an absolute shit party as a kid. Now this one's a bit dark. This is Radithor, radium dissolved in water. Now in the 1920s this was an energy drink designed to give you cure all this shit. Now a side effect of radioactive water is radioactivity. Even Byers is one of the main people who found this out the hard way. He drank so much that his jaw literally fell off. Not only did he never fold another towel again, he died a horrible death and got buried in a lead coffin. Then we've got the original mother made by Coke. This was so fucking bad, it was like a dirty ginger beer. It was so bad that the new one actually said, tastes nothing like the old one. That's when you know something is shit is when you admit it's shit.
