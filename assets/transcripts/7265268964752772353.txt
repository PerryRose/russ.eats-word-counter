Righto, the new Caramilk Caramel Slice, this was fuckin' hard to find. Now just a gentle reminder, we have had a Caramilk Slice block. This is exactly the same except it's Caramilk and Chocolate Biscuits, and there was some fuckin' controversy about this. I gave it a high rating and everyone was complaining that the biscuits were soggy in the block. So I re-reviewed it and they were right. The biscuits were fuckin' soggy. That's the only thing that you don't want a biscuit to be. That's why I don't eat Say-O's anymore. Okay, so I took the cross-sectional area and noticed a key difference. The biscuit is nearly twice the size. Seriously, this is the last block and that's the new one. They must have known and had heaps of complaints at how fuckin' soggy the old bicky was, and they have re-engineered the biscuit. There's only one way to find out. Is it soggy? Okay, so the biscuit's way crunchier, but that is way too sweet. It actually made my eyes water and you could, like, feel it in the back of your throat like I almost was coughing. And you could feel fur growing on your teeth with every bite. Caramello is good, caramilk is good, but together it is fuckin' too much and it tastes nothing like a caramel swiss. That is like drinking, it's like syrup. I don't know how to fuckin' describe it. I'm gonna give that a 4 out of 10 because it is just too fuckin' sweet.
