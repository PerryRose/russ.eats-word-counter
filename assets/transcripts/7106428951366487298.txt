Right-o. The M&M Top and Twix Top Biscand Biscuit. I'm very fucking excited to try these because I didn't think they actually still existed. Thank you Grazing Lane Sweets, who sent me a message and said that they had some, so they sent me a few. They also sent me a big fuck-off box of other treats, like the OG Banana Nesquik, not available in Australia. The fucking original Mountain Dew, not that energised shit they have at KFC. These weird little fucking things. Brain Liquor, fuck you, name it, Wicked Fizz. Just a heap of other shit, including this. Have a fucking look at them, what a flashback, check that out. That's a treat. M&M. Twix. Fuck me. It honestly feels like I've just gotten off my mongoose mischief and ripped one of them out of a Smash lunchbox. I'm giving them both an 8 out of 10. Not just for nostalgia, they're just super buttery and like chewy caramel. They're just tasty, they're just like I remember.
