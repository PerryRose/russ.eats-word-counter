Righto, part 5 of the Russ Eats Bilson's flavour journey, we're revealing the actual can, the fucking design and name of the Russ Eats flavour. Okay, I'm about to move my hands and show you the name, which I'm pretty sure you already know, and the design of the can. The Russ Eats flavour is the Twister. Now I fucking love this. Remember, this is inspired by the Cyclone, it's not the Cyclone. You can see where the inspiration comes from. We've got the red, the green and the orange centre. And I was so much happier with this, because I reckon this will stand out. I reckon there's no other cans on the shelf that looks like this. Another fun fact is that the Twister is what the Paddlehook Cyclone is called in the UK, so it can't be more fitting. Plus, I just found out they've got other flavours over there, so I'm a little bit jealous. Now I'm actually going to show you some of the runners-up can designs, but there's two things that people keep asking. One, this will come out sometime in July, and two, yes, the Russ Eats logo will be on the fucking can. So here's one of the runners-up designs. I absolutely love this, because it was red and green like the outside of the Cyclone, and then the inside was orange, like the inside of a Cyclone, but it looked too similar to Fruit Tangle, in my opinion. This is the other runners-up. Loved the green, it really stood out, but I didn't like these little hula hoop things. I thought that wasn't Cyclone-inspired enough, in my opinion. Did I choose the right design, by the way? I want to hear your thoughts. Fucking don't hold back. I like criticism. And also, this is massive. This is my first real collab. Comment below who else I should collaborate with. I'm thinking like a Russ Eats Oak, fucking Tim Tam. I used to work for him. Surely they can do a little collab with me. Let me know.
