palatable fast food coffee, episode two of the miniseries, we're going to Hungry Jack's, aka Jack's Cafe. If you don't like a coffee, do you tip it out then throw the cup in the bin, or do you throw the whole cup in the bin? If you throw the whole cup in the bin with fluid, you're a fucking cunt. So we're gonna hit up Macca's Guzman Hungry Jack's. Off to Jack's Cafe. It's not a good panning shot of just some filthy scaffolding. There is a lot of scaffolding though. Kind of the pioneers of the $1 servo coffee, they were. I don't trust the dollar coffee, I never will. So I've chucked me anti-chafe undies on, and they're longer than my pants. Yeah, I can still win. Maybe not. Maybe this is a sign. Are you going the wrong way now? You're actually going the right. Oh no, the exit's out there. I hope I've got signage. There's no sign. We're at Scaff. Newcastle, home of Scaff and Staff. Obviously never had a coffee here before, because I respect coffee, Russ doesn't. It's clean, it's so much cleaner. No one's punched the key. Someone had punched through the key off the King Street Macca's. What the fuck is in here? It's 55 cents cheaper. Is it 55 cents better? I'm just kidding, Daniel. They're gonna clean it out. We're gonna forget, we're gonna be here for 40 minutes. Russ Eames. We're undercover, no, that's fucked. Ross. How's it going? Do you guys do coffee at your Christmas? Thanks anyway. No, we don't do coffee. Why? This Hungry Jacks isn't near a nightclub. There's a buy four, let's get one. Do you see that? No. That's a Savage Garden in the background. Supposed to be at the Fight Wallet. Definitely better. There's actually some crema left. It's the same again. Oh, it's shit again. They can't do piccolos. I didn't know what they were at Macca's. Maybe it's a lust problem. Don't come to fast food for a piccolo. They've double-mined me here. Some people would get pissed off if their coffee's not full. I actually rather that, because it usually tastes better. The mochi isn't that. It's scalding hot. I can taste coffee, but I think that's not a good thing. A bitter aftertaste, not as milky. I would still be able to finish that. It's milk again. There's no, it's milk. You can definitely taste more coffee in the last one. Do you want to try that? I think this is still above the Macca's one. They haven't put a full shot in there. They've done a small shot. I think they've actually tipped the coffee from this. This is the one coffee, but they've just split it into two. The piccolo tastes exactly the same. Piccolo should be stronger. They finished pouring yours and poured everything. And I just poured a little bit out, because mine's only this full. This would get me through the day at work, where the Macca's one would ruin my day. Both will ruin my day and have ruined my day so far. The coffee in fucking England is better. Oh. And that's fucking saying something. Yeah. I'm going to give this one a four out of 10. I think if you go flat white, yeah, I'm out. But I'm not a snob, I'm in the middle. Yeah, you're not a snob. I respect, I actually sympathize and empathize with these people as I was one of them. Was one of them. And I think it's okay. But it's not the people's fault. It's the, up the ladder. Everyone here's been legends. It's the fucking, who's making the decision to have a shit coffee in here? It's not their fault. It's just happened. It's the shit coffee. It's shit coffee, I don't want to drink it. I'd rather go to a nice Australian cafe and support a small business. Support a small, small business. We're supporting them by just spreading knowledge that this is absolute fucking dog shit. You could have such a nice coffee. For the same price. Same price. So I'm not finishing this, because I'll probably have a panic attack from the amount of caffeine. And you'll fucking shit yourself again. And I will. Also, quick, if you don't like a coffee, do you tip it out and throw the cup in the bin? Or do you throw the whole cup in the bin? If you throw the whole cup in the bin with fluid, you're a fucking cunt. Because I have emptied these bins at Macca's for years. They're not going to get offended though, if you get. Dumb shit.
