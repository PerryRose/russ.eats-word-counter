Righto, Dare Ice Coffee, the beverage with the shortest residence time in the body than any other is back with Hazelnut Latte flavour. Now Hazelnut Latte has been out before but I feel like on this release they're trying to tell us something different. I don't remember the original tasting anything like Nutella. Speaking of old Dare flavours, I made this collage. Every flavoured Dare that I can remember. We've got Mocha, White Choc Mocha, Hazelnut, Caramel, Vanilla, Toffee Nut, Peanut Butter, Maxi Bond Butterscotch and Choc Mint. And they've done every latte you can get at a cafe except a Dirty Chai. I want a Dirty Chai Dare. I reckon that'd be fucking awesome. Let's do it. I've got one of the big slugs too. This is gonna fucking kill me. It's good but it's the same as I remember. 7 out of 10. Bit disappointed. This needs to be a Hazelnut Mocha to get that Nutella taste. You get the Hazelnut but you don't get Nutella. There's a fucking difference.
