Righto, we've got Boysenberry Ripple Dairy Milk, so I'm really fucking excited for this because I was going to buy a block from New Zealand a few months ago. Not sure if you care, but in New Zealand this was specifically made as the tip-top Boysenberry Ripple Ice Cream flavoured, and they also did it in the lumps. And they've just changed the packaging in Australia and dropped the tip-top name, exact same product. Quick unboxing, we've got Milk and Dream Chocolate with Boysenberry Jelly and Vanilla flavoured cream. Let's see what it looks like. Oh yeah, show the guts. It smells exactly like snack, the snack chocolate, fucking hell. Looks mad. That looks mad. Let's go. Cheers. Ooh. Ooh. Wait. So it tasted super familiar, and it's this. It tastes exactly like the jelly tip block. So if you haven't had this, it's kind of like a very liquidy, almost Turkish Delight raspberry with like a lot of white chocolate flavour. So it's not really Boysenberry Ripple Ice Cream like it's saying. It's kind of like that jelly tip fucking snack chocolate almost. So I'm only going to give it a 7 out of 10. Yeah, it's a little treat, and I will be buying more, but it's not Boysenberry Ripple. So yeah.
