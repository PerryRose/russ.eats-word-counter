Righto, the first of three Smith's Subway collaboration flavors, Meatball Sub. Now by the looks of the photo, it's on white bread with salad. Now in my opinion, a Meatball Sub must be on Italian herbs and cheese, if they've got any fucking left. They never do, and I don't think there should be salad on a Meatball Sub. It's the only sub that should just be meat, cheese, and fucking sauce. Anyway, let's give them a go. First impression, not bad. Look very orange-looking. Yep, they're okay, they're pretty accurate, nothing groundbreaking. You get a lot of meat and tomato up front, and then you get like parsley and maybe a bit of cheese. So I can't really fail them, it's accurate. Six and a half out of ten.
