Righto, we're about to go on a little Sunday adventure to see if Ronnie Mac's McCrispy Chicken stands up to the colonels. Hey, what can I get for you? Hey, I got the online order. Yeah, what was the code? Order, so P for pterodactyl. Yeah. And K for corn, the band. Yeah, and what's that everything today? PK71. Yeah, that one's all good. Awesome, cheers. Thank you. Cheers. You too. Hi, what can I get you? Just a piece of the Colonel's Finest, thank you. Original recipe. Yeah, just one? Yeah. Macca's Colonel's Finest. Quick grease check. That's the KFC grease, that's the Macca's. So there's definitely a difference to the grease. Looks alright. Let's pull a bit apart, see what's in the guts. Fucking lots of black shit. That actually looks fucking disgusting. Anyway, I'll give it a try. Let's go. So, super sus first bite. There's like stuffing in it. Like it's like wet. It's fucking wet batter. I'm going to actually finish the full piece and give you a proper review. So I ate the full piece and a bit of the drumstick. The drumstick was alright, but the normal bit was fucking filthy. It was like stuffing through it and wet. And the batter tasted like this. Like a 90 cent heart shaped schnitzel from the deli. I'm going to give that a fucking 2 out of 10. That's pretty shit. And I just had a bit of the kernels and that's fucking mint compared to this shit. Don't get it.
