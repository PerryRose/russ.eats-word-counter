Righto, strawberry twirl. I love twirls for two reasons. The first reason is because they're like a flake without all the crumbly bits. Now, I don't hate the crumbly bits because of the mess. I hate them because of this fucked up story. So about 15 years ago, the light bulb blew in my family home. Mum unscrewed the light fitting and left it out the back because it was filled with dead bugs. Now, her and a friend were absolutely pissed out the back and she started eating them thinking it was a bowl of flake for some reason and instantly started spitting dead moths out. So every time I see flake crumbs, I think of eating little fucking bugs and it makes me sick. That's the main reason for twirl. The other reason's a bit more pleasant. It's just because they don't fuck around with fancy flavours. Caramel, orange, mint, caramilk, breakaway, mint, breakaway. That's what twirl does. Fucking moths, I can't stop. Let's go. By the way, it's not strawberry shit in the middle. It's just strawberry flavour. That's fucking beautiful. Honestly, it tastes like Neapolitan ice cream but when you're a greedy bastard and only took chocolate and strawberry. It's exactly like that. Simple, effective. I'm giving that a 9 out of 10. It's fucking gorgeous.
