Righto, V-Refresh pineapple watermelon and citrus lemonade. So I was refusing to try these because I fucking hate sugar-free energy drinks. I haven't actually tried them in a few years. Apparently they've gotten better, just like the gluten-free stuff's gotten better. But fuck me, I had a sugar-free Red Bull years ago, and it was honestly like one molecule away from being WD-40. It was one of the most putrid fucking drinks I've ever had. But I've been promised that these are good. Citrus lemonade first. Mm. It's not bad. It's like a melted lemon Clip-O, but you still get a little bit of that typical sugar-free aftertaste, but yeah, all right. Pineapple watermelon. Mm. That's fucking mad. I'm getting hardly any of that fake sugar fucking aftertaste. I'm gonna give that an eight and a half out of 10, but compared to the sugar-free Red Bull, it's a fucking 20.
