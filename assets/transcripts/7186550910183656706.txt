Righto, Coconut M&M's inspired by Bounty. Bounty's just like the Turkish delight in the favourites, you either love it or you hate it. They even know this because in the UK they brought out the no Bounty celebrations this year which caused an absolute stir. Usually I'd be against this kind of bullying against the Bounty and I'd stick up for it. That is until it cockblocked me the other day at the pub. Only $3 left in coins and this strawberry twirl was fucking eyeing me off like the little treat that it was and this Bounty stood in my way. So basically, fuck the Bounty. Let's get into it and see if M&M's can give some Bounty respect back. Cool colour scheme, no coconut smell at all. Straight into it. That's actually not bad at all. It's like a fresh coconut, like a Lamington flavour rather than that fake coconut that's in Candles and Demi's body wash. I'm gonna give that a 7 out of 10. If you like coconut and Bounty, it's pretty good. It's not overpowering. It's quite a treat.
