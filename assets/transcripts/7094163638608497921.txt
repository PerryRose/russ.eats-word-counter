Righto, time to review the new Mega Choc Latte Dare. Now I have no fucking idea what the difference between a Mocha and a Choc Latte is. If you could tell me, please let me know. I get the Mega part of the name because it only comes in a diarrhea-inducing 750ml, but I don't know what the fuck a Choc Latte is. Quick caffeine comparison. To get 160mg you need 2 litres of Mocha Dare, and you would definitely shit yourself before you get there. 1 litre of the new one, 500ml of the ice break, which is equivalent to 500ml of Red Bull. Pretty fucking strong now. Just had a reminder sip of the other two, but I have previously reviewed them, so let's give this one a go to compare. That is so much different to the other ones. That is horrible. It has this fake coffee taste, that is fucked. I'm giving that one a 5 out of 10 compared to the other two. It's shit. Do not bother. Choc Lattes suck.
