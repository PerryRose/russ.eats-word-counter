Righto, I finally found a pack of the Choc Churro Turtle Chips. So you would have seen these all over the internet as the best chips I've ever tried. I don't fucking trust anyone on the internet. Ever since I was directed to meatspin.com and Lemon Party, I've had trust issues on the internet. So I'm here to tell you the fucking truth. Little unboxing, here we go. Cute little chocolate turtle head. Now, I'm going to be quick because I have a little chocolate turtle head coming on myself so let's get this over and fucking done with. Here we go, they smell nice. They look the same as the other ones. On further inspection, there's actually a light chocolate coating and some cinnamon sugar all over them. And there's the middle if you want to fucking, here we go, get right up there. Let's do it. Hmm? Oh yeah? Yeah? So you instantly get the churro taste, the cinnamon and chocolate, but the experience is like dry cereal, not chocolate or a chip. So it's literally like a combination of Chocolate Crispix or Chex and Milo cereal. Somewhere in the middle, but it makes your mouth water. It's actually quite more-ish. I'm going to give it an 8.5, 9 out of 10. Pretty good. But I'm going to check if they actually are cereal with a little bit of milk. That is cereal. That is literally repackaged cereal. I'm dropping that to an 8 out of 10. Just because you call it chips, it's fucking dry cereal. It's alright if you like dry cereal. Just eat dry cereal. Fucking probably cheaper too.
