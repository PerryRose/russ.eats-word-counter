Righto, the return of 3D Doritos. If you don't remember these you're probably under the age of 25. In 1998 until mid-2000s these were probably the biggest thing at the time besides maybe like Blink-182 or something and as soon as I seen these, massive flashback of nostalgia, it instantly threw me back to these little packets that came with a little Tarzo inside mixed with a bit of Cheese TV and MSN, back to simpler times before we were all, now we're all fat with receding hairlines and depression. There we go, yeah, they look exactly how I remember. Fucking hell, look at them. Yeah, so they taste exactly how I remember them. They're like a cheese little mix with a Dorito, heaps of flavoring and salty as. I'm gonna give them an 8 out of 10 but an extra bonus point for nostalgia for me, so 9.
