Righto, Russ rants number two. I mentioned the orange slice yesterday and some of the comments coming to defend this atrocity has pissed me off. So I'm going to go into detail why the orange slice is the shittest biscuit to ever exist. Reason one is simple, it tastes like fucking shit. It is at the bottom of the Arnott's biscuit ladder. It is below soggy say-o. I would rather a soggy say-o over this piece of shit. Reason two, disappointment. When you went into the cupboard at your house or someone's house to go into the bicky barrel, excited for a Kingston, a Monty or even a fucking shortbread cream, to find about 30 of these stale and shit and crumbled up at the bottom, it was a fucking nightmare. Reason three is just confusion. Why the fuck does the orange slice get to stay on our shelves, but all of these absolute fucking treats behind me get the axe? I don't know. Reason number four is flavour taint. The orange slice would leach into all of the other biscuits if left in the barrel long enough, so all of them would end up tasting like an orange slice, which is shit. Now there is a rumour that the orange slice in our assorted creams is going to be replaced by the Delta Jaffa. It still has orange in the middle, so I don't really care. If anyone could confirm this, that would be awesome, but I do think it's only Aldi. Anyway, fuck the orange slice and fuck you if you like them. Nah, that's a bit mean. You're alright.
