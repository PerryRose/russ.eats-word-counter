Righto, the return of the vegan KitKat, the plant-based KitKat, we're gonna see how it stands up to the OG. Also, most people would use this opportunity to take the piss out of vegans, but believe it or not, I used to be a vegetarian for a year, I did it to lose some weight and be a bit healthier. It was fucked, it was pretty fucked. Anyway, long story short, I had it in my Tinder bio, and it must- something happened when I went back to eating meat. I stopped getting matches with certain types of people, so I fucking chucked it back in there, and I realised that other vegans and vegetarians just think that you're more caring and love animals if you're vegetarian, so I just fucking kept it in me bio, and then I'd break their heart and fucking get a quarter pounder on my arm. This is it, it's like a dark chocolate, it's actually nothing like the normal, but we're gonna compare them anyway. Now the OG. Okay, I can't compare them, if you go in with the mindset that the vegan KitKat is gonna be like the normal one, you'll be very disappointed. It is a dark chocolate KitKat. I should have compared it to this, it's pretty good, 7.5 out of 10, I actually don't fucking mind it, but it's not a normal KitKat. Also, something a bit sus I've noticed, contains milk on the back. I didn't write the book of vegan, but milk is not vegan, someone's gotta ask some questions about that one. Little bit sus.
