Righto, the McKrispy burgers out at Macca's, I swear it's been out before but they're claiming it's new, not the return of McKrispy. For a bit of history of chicken patties at Macca's, we've got the OG chicken patty on these two burgers. The value chicken patty that was on the chicken and mayo, it was shit but it was two bucks so it's alright. And we've had the schnitzels that were dry as fuck. There's also been spicy patties but these are just the normal chicken patties they've had and I swear the McKrispy's been one of them. Yeah, code P for pterodactyl, P for pneumonia, 63. P... and what was the second letter, sorry? PP63. PP? PP? PP. Alright, PP? Sorry, one more time please. PP63. PP? Yeah, you're all good. Awesome, thank you. Starting with the normal one, I was wondering where the sauce is. There it fucking is, slopped on one side as usual. It is quite thick but it could be more moist in my opinion. I'm gonna try the other one before I give an overall review. And the deluxe, so what makes this deluxe is that one piece of tomato and bit of cheese hanging off the fucking side and it looks nothing like the photo A, mayo slopped on the edge again. Fuck me, their aim is horrible. Forgot to bite it. Six out of ten, the OG McChicken on a steamed bun is still my number one. There's something about that and these don't come close. They're a step in the right direction but they're just nothing on other chicken burgers I've had, okay? That's the truth, Macca's.
