Righto, we've got a new V-Refresh Green Apple Lemonade flavour. There's a reason I'm so keen on this. And that's because the pink one got 8th place in the 2022 Tree of the Year Countdown. The pink one, in my opinion, is the only sugar-free energy drink that even comes close to these ones behind me. Let's do it. Okay, this one fits smack bang in the middle. It's better than this. This one tastes like a fucked up Clipo, but it's not as good as the pink. It has a little bit of that aftertaste, but if you like Granny Smith, you're a bit of a fuckwit, but you'll like this. It has that bit of a fresh tang about it, not that fake apple flavour, which I think's alright. So 7 out of 10 overall for this one.
