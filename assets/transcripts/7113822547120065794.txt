Righto. Caramel Maltesers. Something simple for once. I'm sick of these fancy pants fucking flavors. I actually thought some of these flavors were a piss take lately. Prosecco and Pink Peppercorns for example. Tasmanian Mint. I couldn't give two fucks where the mint's from. It's mint. And one of the biggest jokes of the new flavors, Murray River Salted Double Choc. They actually, the rules are, they actually had to get salt from Murray River for that flavor. What the fuck's the difference? Salt from Murray River or Saksa. Saksa Salt on your fucking table. I don't get it. But, Maltesers. Something simple. So let's give it a go. Smells exactly like Caramel Nesquik. Caramel Nesquik it smells like. Let's give one a go. 8 out of 10. They're really sweet but they're a Caramel Malteser so you can't really complain. Honeycomb's still my favorite but I will buy these again.
