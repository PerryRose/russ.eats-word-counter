Righto, let's do it. My personal countdown of the best Christmas Choccy variety pack. I've limited it to the original six. These are what I call the OGs. Let's get into it. Now I'm super passionate about my Christmas Choccy's because they're the last remaining surprise on Christmas. I already know I'm getting my 50th fucking Lynx Africa kit that just reminds me of people smoking bongs in a shed at high school. And I'm pretty much certain I'm going to get Guinness World Records 2023. So the Choccy's are the only thing that I'm not sure of. In last place we've got roses. I don't know why, these just don't do it for me. They're the only one on the list that I don't eat and I'll re-gift these fuckers every time. So if you've got a box of roses from me in the past, I obviously don't love you. Then we've got Quality Street. Now firstly they sound like they belong on a Monopoly board. And come to think of it, they're just kind of like cheap roses. So I'm actually going to flip them around. I just can't be bothered re-editing. I'll re-gift these too. Then we've got the Lint variety. Now these are amazing, but they will never last the car ride home. These are not built for the Australian summer. They will melt nearly every fucking time. Then we've got the Ferrero Rocher. These just make you feel a bit fancy, like you're part of the royal family or something. Just without the incest of course. Silver medal goes to the OG Favourites. So Favourites as a brand are the best. Because they've got so many different boxes tailored to what you actually like. But the OG box only gets second place. It's amazing, but it just causes too many fucking arguments every year. And the gold medal on my personal ranking, remember this is just my opinion, is Celebrations. I even fuck with the bounty. I absolutely love this box. I think it's underrated as fuck. Mum, take notes.
