Righto, I've never been so excited to do a video. My first ever Russ Eats Around the World, where I do a singular product. We are doing imported monsters. All of these are sold in America, but also around the whole globe, except here in Australia. Besides the server I got them from. Now, just a warning, after five monsters, I'm probably gonna punch the fuck out of some plasterboard, so look out on the news for a fucking raging Russ. Kicking it off with the Aussie lemonade, which I'm gonna try and do in my best American accent. The Australian lemonade, a delicious lemon flavor, like exotic solo that they have over there, goes great with the shrimp on the barbie and shooting stuff. Cheers. Holy fucking shit, ten out of ten, that could be the best energy drink I've ever had. It is literally a solo with caffeine. By the way, we actually did once have. Next, we've got this one, peach and nectarine flavored, or nectarine in an aluminum can, okay? Nine out of ten, that's like a full sugar ultra peachy keen, amazing. Then we've got the ripper. Six and a half out of ten, really sweet intense pineapple with a kind of cherry aftertaste. Watermelon ultra. Nine and a half out of ten, that's super fake watermelon flavor with no sugar-free aftertaste, gorgeous. And ultra violet. Seven out of ten, super fake grape, but a little too sweet.
