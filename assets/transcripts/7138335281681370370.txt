Right-o. Turtle chips. I've never had more messages to try something than these. These are the savoury flavours. Flamin' Mullet and Sweet Corn. There is a churro flavour, but I cannot find it fucking anywhere. That's the one that went viral. It's literally harder to find in the wild than a real turtle. Unboxing time. By the way, these are found in the international section, not in the chip section. Plus, the little turtle looks like Ducky. Ducky off Land Before Time. Did you know... Fuck me! Did you know that Ducky was killed by her own dad in real life? That's pretty sad. I've ruined the mood, but it's a bit of a fun fact. Here they are. They smell like fucking chicken and corn Maggi noodles, by the way. That smashed me in the face. They look pretty cool. Here's the Flamin' Mullet flavour, and unlike real turtles, no microplastics inside of these. There you go. It's good to know. Sweet Corn first. Flamin' Mullet or Mullet, whatever it is. I don't know. I really don't know on this one. You really need to try them for yourselves. The texture and chip taste reminds me of like four thin JJ's stacked on top of each other. Only way I can describe it. Both get a 7 out of 10 for being different, but I wouldn't rush out for these two. The Sweet Corn really fucking punches you in the face. It's just like a chicken and corn Maggi noodle flavouring sachet. Exactly like that. Where this one is like Indian spices with a little bit of heat. Give them a go and let me know.
