Righto, Curtis Stone's Caramel Sliced Cadbury Block. If you didn't know, this is Curtis Stone, I swear he's on every fucking cooking show and if he walked into a wall, he would look like Dave Taylor. That's what I reckon anyway. Anyway. I'll start with an unboxing. So it's dairy milk chocolate with smooth flowing caramel and vanilla biscuit cream and biscuit pieces. Yeah, that looks fucking incredible. Look at that. That looks fucking good. First thing, it's really hard just to break one piece off, you kind of take half the other piece with you. But, let's go. Mmm, oh yeah. That's fucked up. That's fucked up how good it is. I'm giving it a 9.8 out of 10. It's really similar to this, except instead of peanuts, it's like little crunchy, almost chewy biscuit pieces. Incredible.
