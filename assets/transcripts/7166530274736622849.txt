Right-o, the new Connoisseur Laneway Sweets salted pretzel and rocky road. I've been waiting for these to come on special for fucking weeks so I could pounce and they finally are. I'm not paying ten bucks a box. I even snap off the vine of my tomatoes so they weigh less. I'm a fucking scab. I'm a scumbag. Get over it. Let's have a look at the guts. You can see the photo of them at the top. Chop in. They look pretty fucking good. Actually, that is pretty accurate to the picture if you ask me. There's a salted pretzel and there is the rocky road. Starting with the rocky road, we've got marshmallow and chocolate ice cream, a raspberry swirl and peanuts. Fuck them. So it's a treat, obviously. I've popped the whole fucking thing. I'm definitely getting rocky road vibes, but the raspberry is a bit overpowering and you need the chew. You need chewy marshmallow for it to really be a true rocky road. Seven out of ten. Now the salted pretzel. We've got a caramel and salted vanilla ice cream, salted caramel syrup, pretzel and salt crumb. Personally, I'm a bit over salted caramel. So that's all this is, is another salted caramel with a little bit of a pretzel aftertaste. So if you're into that shit, you'll fucking love it. Me, bit over it. Six and a half out of ten.
