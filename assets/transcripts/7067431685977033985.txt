Righto, another whole new range. Veggie Snaps Himalayan Pink Salt. I'm sick of them fucking with our snacks and putting veggies and whole grains in them. I'm really against it. I just feel like you should eat healthy and eat less of the unhealthy shit. Anyway, there's not anything better about these. I've compared the Nutritionals to normal Smiths, but I'm not gonna knock them till I try them, so let's give them a go. Oh, they look fucking weird. They look kind of cool actually. Let's give them a shot. Okay, probably the blandest thing I've ever eaten, but it's got a good texture. I wouldn't buy these again, but I am gonna try the other flavors. It was interesting. A nice crunchy texture, melts in your mouth a bit. Wasn't too bad. 5 out of 10 for these ones though.
