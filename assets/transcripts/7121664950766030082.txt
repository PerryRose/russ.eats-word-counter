Righto, so I heard a rumour today that I wanted just to hear from me first. Lyft is being put down, sent to the junk food graveyard. It is however being replaced by Sprite Lemon, which I already find a bit confusing and they've added caffeine to it. So if your kids like a lemony soft drink, they're going to have to stick to these three because you don't want them getting caffeine into them, they're annoying as fuck already. Personally, my take on the rumour is that I couldn't care less as long as they put it on tap at Macca's. Could you imagine hungover as fuck, a large double quarter pounder meal with a tangy buck and Lyft? Hangovers? Hangovers wouldn't exist.
