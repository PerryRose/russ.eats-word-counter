Right-o, Maltesers have entered the Bicky aisle with a mint and original flavor. Let's get straight into it. Starting with the original, now a very sus shape. I found the inspiration. I fucking hope Demi doesn't check my search history. Anyway, let's get into it. There's the cross-section. It pretty much tastes exactly how I expected it would. It's a really nice malt biscuit that melts in your mouth, that's covered in chocolate. It's nowhere near the level of a Malteser, so I'm going to give it a 7.5 out of 10, but it is quite a pleasant Bicky, I'll tell you that much. Now the mint. If you're a mint chocolate fan, you'll love that. It's exactly the same mint as an Aero Bar. So imagine that mixed with an Aero Bar. That's what that one tastes like. I'm gonna give that one an 8 out of 10. I actually quite like that.
