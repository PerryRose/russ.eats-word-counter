Righto, the hunt for festive piss continues. Episode 2, Bailey's tiramisu. This looks absolutely delicate. I've actually just gotten back from the first family Christmas from the year. I'm actually a bit pissed now, to be honest, and I'm hoping that this sends me straight to bed by 7 o'clock. Now, tiramisu is like a sweet coffee flavor, so I think that's gonna go really well with Bailey's. Let's fucking go. Okay, this tops last night's as the dessert festive piss of choice, and there's no rum in it, so the risk of head-butting family is a lot lower. This tastes like a melted Macca's sundae mixed with Bailey's. I'm getting fuck-all coffee. That's the only negative, but that is an absolute treat. It's only 17%, but I'm giving that one an 8.5 out of 10. Not bad.
