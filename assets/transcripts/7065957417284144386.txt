all right cheeseburger flavored melts now they've put red onion on the front cover and I've never known anyone to put fucking red onion on a cheeseburger so I just know these are gonna be shit anyway if you didn't see the other night the original ones were a 2 out of 10 and probably the worst thing I've ever tried so if let's see if they let's see if they can get any worse right if you didn't see it before look at that like a wet it's all over my fingers a filthy wet cheese I do not want to eat this it tastes the same as the other night they made my mouth and eyes water and I had to spit it out it actually felt like I was gonna fucking spew they were the worst thing they're the first ever zero out of ten tastes like the same as the other night but with dirt they're fucked
