Right now, a bit of a scandal. This is so fucking funny. There is a particular restaurant that I'm not going to name that is retraining every single one of their employees on their social media policy basically as a reaction because I leaked a heap of shit from their company. Now, the ironic part is that people are leaking this video to me. At least 150 employees have sent this through to me. Now, I'm going to make sure it doesn't glitch and show their logo like it obviously glitches here where you can see my fucking face in the unacceptable example video. Now, the funny thing is this has backfired because more people than ever are leaking all of the upcoming launches from this particular company to me. The only reason I haven't done a leak video on those upcoming launches are because they're fucking shit. They're absolute dog shit, so I just haven't bothered. Anyways, I'm happy to call a truce if you let me choose the upcoming product. That's my deal, okay? We'll call a truce. Happy to work with you, not against you. Cheers.
