Righto, we've got a scandal about this, fucker. You cannot customise the Milo McFlurry. Here's proof. On the app, Oreo McFlurry. Customise ingredients. You can add five flakes, five M&Ms. You can do whatever you want, because that's what we want to do. We want to add shit and make it a little bit fancy. Have a look at this. Milo McFlurry, customise ingredients, nothing. All you can do is remove the Milo and have a fucking plain one. I thought this was a glitch. Went through the drive-thru, couldn't add anything. They actually put the hot fudge in a cup separate. I had to scoop it in and I've had people confirm in the comments something about Nestle not being able to up the calories because it's a health food. Milo's not a health food, fuck off. This is un-Australian, by the way. They're trying to control us. They're ruining the best dessert we've ever had. They can actually get fucked.
