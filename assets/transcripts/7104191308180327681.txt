Righto, Bold Bar- oh, he got in the picture. Sorry about that. I'm going to try it again. Bold BBQ Doritos. So, I've noticed that these support the ReachOut.com free online mental health service. Lots of good info on the back, but I hope you don't mind. I am just going to focus on the flavour and the chips themselves for this review. In recent times, Doritos have had these two BBQ flavoured chips. The Pizza Hut BBQ Meat Lovers and the Flame Grill BBQ. They're kind of the same. This one was a little bit more smoky. They were alright. By the way, I have very limited trust since Doritos brought out this fucking Reflux flavoured chip back in the day. This is one of the worst chips I've ever had besides those cheese ones I reviewed a few weeks ago. Yep, they smell exactly like the other BBQs. They're alright. 6.5 out of 10. If you like BBQ flavoured shit, you'll love them. I personally don't, but they deliver to what they say they are. They're alright.
