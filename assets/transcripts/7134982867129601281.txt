Right-o, Alan's inspired by Kirk's. Lemonade, cream and soda and Pocito. Now this is Alan's fourth collab in the last couple of years. They've done Drumstick, they were shit. Frosty Fruits, they were shit. And Milk Bottles, you guessed it, shit. So that should explain why I'm not very passionate about this collab. By the way, no bad blood against Kirk's, this has nothing to do with Kirk's. Let's go. Here they are. They smell pretty good. Start with Pocito. Pocito's good. Tang, Pocito flavour, that's fucking mad. That's an 8 out of 10. Let's go with fucking, what was lemonade? Lemonade. They've nailed that too. That is lemonade. Not as tangy. Fucking 7.5 out of 10. Pretty good. Cream and soda. 7 out of 10 for the cream and soda. Overall, 7.5 for the bag. I'm pretty fucking impressed. They've nailed the flavours. The Pocito has a really nice tang to it. I'm impressed. I'm glad I gave it a shot, Alan's. You've redeemed yourself here.
