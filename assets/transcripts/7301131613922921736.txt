Righto, I have some breaking news. The biggest news I've ever had, okay. Hard Solo, the biggest pre-mix that has ever launched. It has broken records. Personally, I think Twister was better. But there's something about seeing a childhood drink like Solo turn into piss that gets me excited. Like, imagine a Hard Pop Top. Anyway, I'll cut the shit. Hard Solo Zero Sugar will be launching next February to March is what I have heard. Now, the reason I'm so excited is this is going to take over the low-sugar lemon piss market, in my opinion. It's only 4.5%, not 6 like the others. But we're not all pissheads. I think that'll do. And there's something about Solo Zero Sugar that I have as the gold standard. I can hardly taste a difference, followed by Pepsi Max, of course. I am so fucking keen on this, if you can't tell, okay. I'm pretty excited.
