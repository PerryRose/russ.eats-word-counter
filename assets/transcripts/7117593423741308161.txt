Righto, we're off to Macca's to get the new creme brulee McFlurry and creme brulee pie. Let's go. Hey, were you using the app today? No, not the app. What can I get for you? Could I try that new creme brulee pie? Yep. Which one? Yeah, the creme brulee. Can I get one of those? Yes, please. And I'll try the ice cream, the creme brulee McFlurry. Yep. Delicious. Oh, awesome. There's just a Minute 40 wait on the pies. We do have apple pies if you'd like that. Are you happy to wait? I can wait a Minute 40, yeah. I'll just go to the next window and we'll bring it up. Yeah, awesome. Sorry about that, mate. That's alright. Have a great time. Thank you. Cheers. A Minute 40, my fucking arse. Move, car. Here's the McFlurry. It does look like a little treat in the middle. It's got like creamy bits here and fucking creamy bits there. It's got a little creme brulee. It's got a little creme brulee. It's got a little creme brulee. It's got a little creme brulee. It's got a little creme brulee. Here's the McFlurry. It does look like a little treat in the middle. It's got like creamy bits here and fucking caramel here. McFlurry. Pie. Oh, fuck. McFlurry's a 6 out of 10. It's just like someone smashed a fucking pie through some ice cream and mine was melted as fuck. But the pie is amazing. I'm going to give that an 8 out of 10. It's like a different caramel to the sundae caramel and the creamy shit's mad but not as good as the caramel banana but still pretty fucking good.
