Right, it turns out Billson's also doing gin. I know it's a Sunday and I don't usually have piss on a Sunday But I couldn't fucking say no to these. Now usually gin isn't my go-to Unless we're talking Tekken 3 characters or cutest lost characters So I'm not going to claim that I'm a gin expert But you don't have to be a fucking musician to know a good song You don't have to be a gin expert to know if something's a fucking treat. Anyway starting with tangerine Now I'm a bit confused on what a tangerine actually is and by that I mean, I don't know the difference between a tangerine and a mandarin. Are they the same thing? Can someone please tell me in simple terms what the fucking difference is? Googling has only made me more confused. The Coles website says the ingredients are a hundred percent certified Organic lamb, which I'm going to assume is a typo, but if it's not vegans are going to be fucking pissed. Let's do it Now the raspberry and the lemonade Okay, so I'm not used to having gin with sweet shit Usually it's just with tonic water, a squeeze of lime And I swear a place in Sydney once put like pot puree in my gin once which fucking pissed me off Anyway, tangerine one you definitely taste the gin and it's just like a mandarin flavor Nowhere near as sweet as the other Bilsons which are basically like a confectionery. I don't know about this one I'm going to give it a six out of ten. It's alright. The raspberry one just tastes like a raspberry cruiser to me Which is a treat. I'm not tasting gin at all I'm going to give that one a six and a half out of ten But this one feels posh. The gin with the sweet lemonade just works. That one is an eight out of ten I fucking don't mind it
