Righto, it's a Russ Eats and Domino's debut, I'm going to take you on a tour of the new Melts range. Now I know what you're thinking, couldn't you just fold your own pizza? Yeah, you could, but you're fucking lazy, you could also make your own, but that's why we've got Domino's, and it usually ends up cheaper to be honest. These ones come with garlic and cheese on top, and they're pressed, six flavours, let's go. Now there's no more rule for paid promos, I don't give reviews, so what we're going to do is that thing Rank It But You Can't Change It, where I try every flavour one by one and give it a place, you know, the fucking thing the kids are doing these days. Start with the chicken and avo, that one's very brunchy, that'd go well with a coffee, but I'm going to put it at number five. Vege-rama, okay, I actually love olives, people are going to hate that, but I think there's better to come, so number four for that one. Butter chicken, okay, it's good, but I didn't come to Domino's for Indian food, okay, so I'm filling up the number six spot. The three meats, now this is what I come to Domino's for. Number one, I've already hoofed the whole fucking piece down. The pepperoni, pepperoni always hits the spot, my number one pizza. I'm going to have to put it two because there's no other rules, but that's actually number one, okay. And lastly, the ham and cheese. That is a ham and cheese toastie on steroids, but it has to go number three, that's the rules. Now to give my honest opinion of the range, it is the perfect way to eat pizza on the move. The two bits gives it some stiffness, I don't mind a bit of stiffness, and none of the shit falls out. This is the fucking way of the future. And a cheeky red velvet lava cake, they are that good. They should be served at a Hatton restaurant, that's what they deserve, okay.
