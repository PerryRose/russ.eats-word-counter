Right-o, Daryl Lee and Lifesavers, Musk and Raspberry Jellies chocolate. Now you either love or hate Musk. Personally, I absolutely love the flavour, but I hate the texture of a Musk stick. But Lifesavers Musk and these Mini Musks are fucking mad. Speaking of Mini Musks, this is what came up when I googled Mini Musk. Anyway. It's the third Lifesavers and Daryl Lee chocolate block, and if it's not obvious, Daryl Lee purchased Lifesavers in 2018. That's why they've been fucking bouncing off each other with all this new shit. Anyways, let's do it. A couple of Musk bits there, and then a big fat jelly. Let's go. Okay, if you like Musk, go buy a fucking block right now. That works. I don't know, I didn't think it would work, but that fucking works. You get like normal chocolate up front, and little crunchy, shitloads of little crunchy Musk bits throughout, then big fat chewy jellies, and then you get hit with this Musk aftertaste. It works so well. If you like Musk, I reckon you'll think this is 9 out of 10. If you don't, then don't fucking bother, obviously.
