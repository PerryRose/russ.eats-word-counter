Righto, part two of Russ Eats Around The World, we're doing New Zealand. Now they've got some fucking treats, so I'm going to do this in a couple of parts. I'm starting off with the shit that you can get at Coles locally. Australians and New Zealanders are like siblings. We're super fucking competitive, but we do like ya. And I like to think you guys like us too over here. Now, when you type in New Zealand, this is what you get behind me. Personally, when I hear New Zealand, I think of Hobbits, the All Blacks, fucking Crowey, the Flight of the Conchords and Lorde. And I think she's kind of shit, no offence. Starting with the Bluebird Cheesy Bacon Rations. They kind of look like and feel like twisties. Six and a half out of ten. They're like cheese and bacon balls meet twisties, but they're just a bit dry. L&P Lemon and Pairoa. Now, I thought it was lemon and Pairoa was another fruit. Pairoa is the town. Bit of history there. Let's go. Eight and a half out of ten. It's like Solo, but with like a lemon lolly flavour rather than a tangy lemon, which is mad. Big Fizz Fage. Oh, this time it is a fruit, not a town. I've never tasted a drink anything like that. That's a seven out of ten because it's so unique, but it's fucking odd. Now, I've had a million pineapple lumps and peanut slabs. I can tell you right now. Nine out of ten. One of the best Chockies with the best chew you'll ever have. Peanut slab, seven out of ten. Boring, but one of the best peanut chocolates on the market. The Pixie Caramel. Nothing special. It's just like a caramel fudge covered in chocolate. The Chocolate Fish. Meh. The Perky Nana. I know it sounds like Nana got a boob job, but these are a nine and a half out of ten. Like the pineapple lumps, but banana and better chocolate. Amazing.
