Righto, the low-key treat of the month for January are these fuckers behind me. I've been keeping these to myself for about six months, okay? I'm a bitch for the air fryer, I'm an absolute lazy cunt, and hot chips just never hit the same as deep fried until I bought these. Okay, have a look. I'm that passionate about these that you're gonna think it's a fucking Deno's Direct ad. This isn't an ad, I'm just that passionate. I have finally found a chip that hits the spot. They also have straight ones that are good, but the crinkle cut just hits better. Seriously, have a fucking look at them. They look deep fried. They've got that slight sogginess and that crispiness, and the inside's fucking gorgeous. These are a 10 out of 10 when it comes to air fried chips. No other chips come even close. I don't want another spud shortage, so please don't be a fucking greedy guts with these, but fuck me, I eat them every night. I'm getting heaps fucking fat too.
