Righto, and good morning, a little breakfast review, the new Weiss Bix, but I've got to get something off my chest before we begin this. I heard there are people out there that use hot milk or microwave their Weiss Bix and have hot Weiss Bix. It's not fucking porridge. We literally got taught never eat soggy Weiss Bix and there's people out there making it soggy on purpose. That is absolutely fucked. Are there people watching this right now that heat their Weiss Bix up? I want to know what the fuck's going on there. Anyways, this is mango flavoured and it's got a pretty full and pungent mango smell if you ask me. I've also got groove in the moo in a few hours and I'm making sure I have a hearty breakfast because last year I literally had like 12 beers and one chip on a stick and I was absolutely fucked. Anyway, let's get into it. It's all right, the flavour's there. It's just not sweet enough. It should have been in the Weiss Bix Bites and the Weiss Bix Bites seem to stay crunchier for longer. Look at this, absolute mush, a little soggy sale and it's only been about fucking 60 seconds. I'm going to give this a 4 out of 10. Pretty bland, pretty boring, should have been the Weiss Bix Bites but Weiss Bix, that's clever. I did like that.
