Right-o, the Vegemite Chook with the cheesy stuffing. Let's get straight into it. I'm gonna have to do an unboxing So it's actually got a Vegemite marinade. Look at that. Fuckin' hell. Let's get this bastard out. There we go. Smack the fuck out of it. Little feet are tied up, poor fella. Oh, the poor thing. They have absolutely filled it to the brim with stuffing. So I've got one of each body part. It looks like I'm trying to fucking assemble Exodia or something. I'm gonna start with the skin. That was just normal Chook, eh? I'm gonna see if the drumstick can redeem itself. That's a fucking scam. I even sucked on the wing to see if I could get any Vegemite. There is no fucking Vegemite flavour at all. That is just a barbecued Chook in fucking pretty packaging. I'm giving that a 1 out of 10 because it's offensive to Vegemite, which is offensive to Australia. That's fucking bullshit. Anyway, I'll give the stuffing a go, even though I hate stuffing. Let's do it. The stuffing's alright, which is sad because the best bits come out of the fucking chicken's arsehole. I'm probably gonna give that a 5.5 out of 10. Bit of a cheesy, herby little treat. Overall, do not fucking bother. Do not give them your money because they do not fucking deserve it until they start putting effort into food. Steve Irwin would be rolling in his grave. This is an Australian disaster. Fuck it off, Coles. Pull your head in.
