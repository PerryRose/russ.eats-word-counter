Righto, Maximus has entered the zero sugar market and they've asked me to get the word out there. I'm sick to death of promotions for these kind of drinks being aimed at athletes when 99% of us are just regular people like me and you. That is why Maximus has reached out to me as a representative of the people that actually drink these drinks. So for this, I wanted to show you a real Maximus moment, okay? None of this bullshit. This is actual footage from 11 a.m. on Saturday morning. I gave Demi the phone to record me. I had pre-loaded a Maximus Zero Sugar in the fridge after way too many beers. I'm not an athlete, I'm just someone who hasn't drank liquid other than beer in the last 24 fucking hours. On this particular day, I didn't even have to swallow the Maximus. It just absorbed directly into my tongue like this episode of SpongeBob, if you remember this. Anyways, for those who have followed me for a while know that I've went through four emotions with sugar-free drinks. There's been anger, denial, acceptance, and now I'm embracing them. The technology has come a long way and they taste so much better. Do you just remember that sugar-free cordial from back in the day? That was fucking sew-rich. Cheers, let's do it. That's mad. It tastes like a normal Maximus Blue. You can tell it's a sugar-free drink. There was a slight aftertaste, but it's enjoyable. I'm not going to give it a rating though. You know how I work with paid promotions, but give it a shot. Let me know what you think. Maximus Zero Sugar. I'm a sellout. You know that.
