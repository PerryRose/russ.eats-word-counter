Righto, two new Pringles flavours. We've got Cheesy Garlic and Meat Lover's Pizza. Now, there is some huge news in the dehydrated spuds in a tube world and that is Pringles do not have a monopoly anymore. They have competition and old enemy Lay's Stacks are back in Australia on our shelves. So Pringles CEO, if you are watching this, please start putting effort into your flavours because they've been fucking pissed for the last five or ten years or we will switch. We have an alternative now and we're not scared. Anyways, we'll start with Meat Lover's Pizza. Now, Meat Lover's Pizza, I don't really buy anymore. If I'm looking for a meaty pizza, I'll usually go with the Double Bacon Cheeseburger which is basically Meat Lover's but with a big spooge over the top. Anyways, let's do it. They smell exactly like the inside of a Pizza Hut or Domino's. That's probably one of the most accurate Meat Lover's Pizza flavours I've ever had. I'm pretty impressed. They're not bad. I'm going to give them those fucking seven and a half. Now, let's do the Cheesy Garlic. Okay, so they're super different to these garlic flavoured things. They taste like pub entree garlic bread if that makes sense but a little bit sweeter. They're not bad but probably only a six.
