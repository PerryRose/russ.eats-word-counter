Righto, the 2023 Stinker Awards Part 2, we've got the podium finish. Here was 8th to 4th yesterday, I ran out of time because I was that angry at how shit these products are. Let's go. The bronze medal goes to this Phantom Mystery flavour. This was fucked. It tasted like gumption. You could clean your toilet with this shit. And apparently it was apple strudel flavour. Bullshit. It was maybe Green Apple Little Trees air freshener for your car, but it wasn't apple strudel. But I'll tell you what it was. It was fucking shit. The silver medal goes to the McDonald's Scallop Slash Potato Cake, wherever you're from. These looked and tasted like an old man's heel. The worst part though, the reason these are so high up on the list, is because they released them when we were having a potato shortage around the country. So all the local fish and chip shops were struggling to get potatoes, then Macca's decides to release this around the whole country. And they were fucking shit, like a sponge of oil. They were an embarrassment to a potato scallop. And first place, it's making me sick thinking about it, the Special Burger Sauce Hot Cross Buns. Fuck you Coles, fair enough upping your prices to make bulk profits. But releasing this, that's the fucking final straw, you absolute cunts. I still remember the smell of opening the packets. It was like when you leave your washing in the washing machine for a few days. The bit that gave this product the crown is the 2023 Stinker, with the bits of dried pickle. They looked and what I imagine tasted like the actual foreskin from Meat the Fockers. Absolute dog shit.
