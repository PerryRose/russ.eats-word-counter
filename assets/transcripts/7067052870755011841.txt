Righto, brand new range from Smiths. We've got the double crunch range. I'm starting with the original because I'm really, I need to see if it's double crunch before I even fuck around with the other flavors. Yeah fuck, they look crunchy. Look at that, look at how deep that is. They look mad. Alright, let's try them. Oh hear that? That's fucking crispy, that is dry. Let's really hear this crunch. Yeah, they're mad. They're like probably 1.8 crunch, not 2, but they're like a normal Smiths and a Red Rock Deli, they're like in the middle. Seven and a half out of ten.
