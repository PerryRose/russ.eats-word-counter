Right-o, Snackology, the study of snacks, episode 5, is your chocolate real? You will never look at chocolate the same way. I'm diving fucking deep into this. Now this was sparked from products saying real chocolate and real dark chocolate. I've always thought, why the fuck are you telling me it's real? Of course it's real, it's chocolate. In Australia and New Zealand, to call something chocolate, you must meet the definition of chocolate. Now in simple terms, real chocolate is made of cocoa butter and liquor, whereas fake chocolate basically adds spin to the chocolate and gets rid of the cocoa butter and the milk and just adds vegetable oil. The reason that this is important is that fake chocolate tastes like shit. Now I'm going to give you some examples. First example is the word choc versus chocolate. When you see the word choc nine times out of ten, it's fake chocolate. The only exceptions I found were the extra choc Maltesers and triple choc Tim Tam, where when you flipped over the packet, it was actually real chocolate. But 100% of the time, if you see the word chocolate, it's fucking real chocolate. Let's start with the chocolate aisle. The only two products I found that said choc were the choccy milk bottles and freckles. And when you flipped them over, shitty compound chocolate just like I fucking told you. These two are also compound chocolate, but you can't fucking change them. In the cookie aisle, you got these two that say choc and these two that say chocolate. Flip the top two over and just like I told you, shitty compound chocolate. Don't even bother with the muesli bar aisle. Pretty much all of them were fake ass chocolate. One of the only ones that were real were the nice and natural range that had real chocolate. And in the ice cream aisle, these ones were fake chocolate. And there you have it, some tricks to not eat shit choc.
