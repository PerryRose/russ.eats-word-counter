Right, uh, Coco Pops Easter Eggs. I don't usually review the Easter Eggs because you get half as much and they're twice the price, but I couldn't knock these back. I do hope they taste like a Coco Pop Crackle. I haven't had these in fucking years, but I do have a bad flashback when it comes to Coco Pops. Years ago, I went on a date and I thought this girl had a Coco Pop stuck to her lip, but she actually had a little growth there and I pointed it out and she said now I'm self-conscious, and yet the date didn't obviously go well. Also, don't forget the Russ Eats Game Show. 8.30 Sydney time tonight, you win this rare black cord hat, Twitch link in bio, blah, blah, blah. Here they are. Also, worst weather for chocolate. It's 42 degrees tomorrow. I'm gonna have to put the aircon on just to save all the choccy I've got in the fucking cupboard. Nah, 5.5 out of 10. There's something missing. I'm not sure if the Coco Pop flavour is getting lost with the chocolate, like they're too similar, or there's not enough Coco Pops. I could definitely feel a lot, but I feel like a block, like a crunch block would have been way better. Like they did with the Rice Bubbles, they could have packed them in, everyone would have been happy, but I'm disappointed, especially that they're double the fucking price too.
