Righto, I've been waiting so long for this, the Zero Sugar Hard Solo Hard Rated. Now we obviously all know the story, but this is what it was supposed to be. I can't help but think this looks like an Aldi knock-off. Which does remind me Aldi, we're waiting for a hard jump or a hard sunlit. Or even a hard Professor Peppy or Dr Dazzle. And don't worry, if you drink too much, a couple of Hedonol or Hediphen, and a bowl of Power Grain and you'll be fine. It goes great with some Ricky Ponting cricket, my favourite players Adam Galkrast and Shane Ward. I'm sorry, I won't do a cricket reference again. 4.5%, 1.3 standard drinks, let's fucking go. Okay, listen closely. Firstly, yes, massive fucking yes. The 4.5% is the best part of this, right? Because the Suntories, we've all gotten way too blind on them. I nearly gag at the fucking taste of them these days. So this is a perfect session drink. I think it's going to revolutionise the Zero Sugar drinks. This is fucking absolutely gorgeous. It's nearly identical, 9.5 out of 10 by the way. The only thing is you can definitely taste the alcohol a little bit more than the regular Hard Solo because it's a Zero Sugar. But that is naughty and yummy and sexy.
