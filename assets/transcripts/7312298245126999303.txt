Righto, the 2023 Stinker Awards, the shittest products of the year. Last year, Meltz got the crown, these were Smegma on a chip, they still make me gag even fucking thinking about them. In 8th place, we've got the Monster Canned Coffee. It tasted like a fucking instant coffee that went cold. Absolute dog shit. In 7th place, the Boneless Pieces from Hungry Jacks. They tasted like home brand air fried processed fucking chicken. Absolute dog shit. The fact that they thought this would take on KFC and Red Rooster is embarrassing. It's actual permanent brand damage happened because of this launch. In 6th place, the New V. Surely they learnt from the Shapes incident. They had no reason to change the formulation and for that, shit. 5th place, the Vegemite Greens collab. You've got to be fucked in the head to have thought this was a good idea. It tasted like normal brownies. I'm ashamed that I actually baked these in my oven, by the way. Tasted like normal brownies that were a little bit salty, a little bit sus, that you would cut up with the knife left in your sink that still has Vegemite on it. That's what this tasted like, which is shit. 4th place, we've got Prime. What an absolute letdown. These were so hyped. People were paying $50 a bottle and then when we finally got to try them, they tasted like fucking piss. Like straight cordial. Orange was the only one that was really okay. And Wooly started selling them and no one's buying them now that you can get them and they're not cool anymore. Fucking shit. I've run out of time. Part 2 coming tomorrow for the podium finish.
