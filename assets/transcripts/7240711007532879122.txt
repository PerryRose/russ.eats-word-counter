Righto, it's my birthday today, the big 29. Little hungover and I usually go for a double quarter pounder. And I'm not doing the double pounder. Fuck the imperial system. I'm doing the kilogrammer. Mind the voice too. I was at karaoke last night. Did do duality by Slipknot. 15 years ago in year nine, I did the double pounder and didn't even break a sweat. Could I please have a double quarter pounder by itself? But could I add seven extra patties and seven bits of cheese? So there's nine patties total. Um, is that all? Um, and a medium Diet Coke. Look at that. That is fire. That's a full cow. Needs sauce. Oh, that needs sauce. Needs balance too. Oh no. It's falling on the ground when I got the sauce. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh no, oh no, that's fucked. Why did they even hear it fall? It's just mush. Now I'm not built like I used to. I'm fucking tapping out at about 60%. I'm not full. It's just making me want to gag and it's me fucking birthday. So get off me back. Let me have the benefit of the doubt for this one. I'm not built for this shit. I'm a snack man, okay? I'm a fucking snack man. I should have just reviewed the fucking Woolies mud cake like I was supposed to. Shit birthday, shit burger.
