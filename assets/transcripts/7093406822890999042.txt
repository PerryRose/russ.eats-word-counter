Alright, I'm going to do something different and show you some of the shittest products to ever hit the shelves around the world. Up first we have Pepsi AM. This was aimed at the breakfast cola drinker and went fucking horribly because the small amount of people that have Coke or Pepsi for breakfast were happy with just sticking to a Coke or a Pepsi. This one just confuses me. In 1980 Colgate decided they're going to break into the lasagna world away from toothpaste and for obvious reasons this went fucking horribly. Wow chips were released in 1998 in America. These were fat free Lay's Doritos and Ruffles and were made with a fat substitute called Olestra which is now banned in many countries around the world because it literally makes you shit yourself. Last but not least we have Shrek ravioli from Macca's in around 2010 in Australia. If you let your kid eat these you are a fucking shit parent.
