Righto, some big news. I'm recording from my car. That's how big this is, okay? I'm on my break at fucking work. Hard Solo, it's been banned, okay? Have a fucking look at this. I was leaked an official statement sent to their customers. Hopefully, you can read that. If not, let me know and I'll put it as my story. They are bringing it back out next February as hard-rated. In my opinion, it'll be the exact same, but there's something about seeing Solo on the can that makes it so much better. This also means Hard Solo Zero Sugar will most likely be released as hard-rated Zero Sugar, if at all. I want it to be the one that broke you this news. Apparently, they're going to do a media release that will prove if all this is true, but I'm pretty fucking certain it is. It's a sad day. It is a sad day in piss history, so I want it to be the one that broke it, okay? This is fucking sad. Let us have some fun. Let us play.
