Righto, the new Rockstar Refresh Summer Fruits and Watermelon Kiwi. I think this one's new, that one definitely is, I'm going to try them both anyway. Now I fucking love Rockstar. It's always been my go-to, the Purple and Green Punch were my favourite, this one's still around, fucking try it if you haven't, and I love the watermelon, it was like a sherbet-y tang watermelon. So fucking good. The only thing that annoys me is every time I go to Rockstar, that fucking Nickelback song gets stuck in my head. Now I'm not talking shit about that album, that album slaps, no Silver Side up, but it fucking slaps. It's just that particular song that I think is absolute shit, it always gets stuck in my head, and it reminds me of an alternate universe where Nirvana and Morgan Wallen write music together. And that's a universe I want no fucking part of. Sorry, I went on a bit of a tantrum there, I almost forgot that I was doing a review. Anyway, it's a nice peachy colour, very similar colour to my Twister Billsons, next Wednesday a little announcement by the way, a little hint, keep your eyes peeled. Anyway, just noticed these are sugar-free, I don't mind, I'm starting to get around sugar-free energy drinks, especially in the Monster range, they're not fucking bad. 7 out of 10, the aftertaste isn't as good as the Monster range, but it's got a nice peachy flavour, a little slight tang, quite sweet, not bad. Watermelon Kiwi, that looks fucking toxic. 5 out of 10, it's okay, but it tastes like a vape flavour which is just turning me off, so I just can't get around it. Very artificial and chemically tasting, the full sugar watermelon absolutely shits on this.
