Right-o, the Lotus Biscoff Kit-Kat Chunky is finally available everywhere in Australia. So I've been chasing these bastards over the globe for the last two years because they're that fucking good. Started in 2020 when I got them online from Europe. Then they're finally available in Australia, but Kit-Kat being the cockteasers that they are, only sold them from their chocolatory in Melbourne. And of course I went there and bought fucking heaps of them. I also spent about a hundred bucks on other weird flavors like hot cross bun and carrot cake. There's even baklava, however the fuck you say it. But here we are two years later and for one dollar each, I've got three of the bastards from Coles Isavo. And I'm a very, I'm the hard bloke to please and I'm very happy. So let's give it a try. Thick slather on top of the Lotus. Remember I've already tried these, but I actually reckon they've got better. I gave them a nine out of ten last time, but they're a fucking nine and a half. One buck each, get one now. You
