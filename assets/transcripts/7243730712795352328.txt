Righto, the return of the Tower Burger at KFC, this could not have come at a better time. Not only is it the end of the long weekend, I've also been on a Bucks party all weekend. And I'm still no good, so this, I fucking need it. Now I do apologise, when I did announce that this was returning, I showed this photo which shows two bits of chicken, this only has one. I also found this the other day, I don't think it existed in Australia, but I had to show someone. Fun fact, I can finish through the fire and the flames on Expert, don't even break a sweat. Now I actually got recognised when I ordered this, and the positive to that is they've taken extra care. The cheese is even scented, the cheese is never scented on a fast food burger. But I do have a fear that one day when I'm recognised, someone will fuck with my shit, just to watch me eat something that they've fucked with on camera. Don't get any ideas, if I find out anyone's ever fucked with my shit, I'll come in and I'll dunk your head in the fucking fryer, you little bastard. Anyways, let's go. I knew it'd be good, it's a fucking KFC burger with a big filthy hash brown on it, of course it's good. I'm gonna have to give that a 9 out of 10 when you're hungover. I'm glad it's only got one bit of chicken though, I reckon two would be way better.
