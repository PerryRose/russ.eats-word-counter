Right, I finally found it, the Rainbow Paddle Pop Oak. This is the third Streets and Oak collab, we had the Gaytime and then the Splice and now the Paddle Pop. I'll bet my fucking nuts, Bubble O Bill is next by the way, and I feel like this will be the best out of the lot. Now heaps of people were saying, who cares, Rainbow Paddle Pop's just caramel flavour. We all fucking know that now, they don't even hide it anymore, it literally says it on the container. And they're saying it like caramel oak is a bad thing. In my opinion, it's about time we had a caramel oak. We had the Molten Caramel, which was one of the best oaks of all time, and all these caramel spinoffs were pretty shit in my opinion, so I'm keen as fuck. So it's a light pink colour, I was curious what colour they'd make it, I thought it was gonna be like a greeny blue, turns out they removed the green blue from the Rainbow Paddle Pop, that's how long it's fucking been since I had one, anyway. They have fucking nailed that, it makes me feel like I'm ten years old again. I know it's probably just a caramel milk, I don't know if it's the fucking packaging brainwashing me, but that is a Rainbow Paddle Pop milk, it couldn't be any more accurate. I love it, fucking, no one, no one, no one entertained me.
