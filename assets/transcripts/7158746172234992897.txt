Righto, Black Currant Jellies, Lifesavers, Daryl E. I can't fucking keep up with Daryl E's flavours, seriously, they've got a new one every week. The only reason I'm trying this is because I love Lifesavers, so I wanted to do a little flashback. So the block's obviously based off the Black Currant ones, but I fucked with all these. I even fucked with Musk. I hate Musk sticks, but there was something about these Musk Lifesavers that were a treat. I don't even know which ones you can get anymore. I've seen the Fruit Tingles, but that's about it. And does anyone else remember the Strawberry Sundae? Someone DM'd me these the other day. I fully forgot, they were mad. Let's get into it. There's a few jellies in there. The smell fucking punches you in the face. It is exactly like the Black Currant Pastilles, but it's full on. As soon as you open it, straight in the face. Anyway, let's go. It's honestly too much. The texture's nice, lots of jellies, but there was just this fucking overwhelming, like, deodorant, perfumey, Hello Kitty body spray flavour. And I know why. I tried some of the chocolate by itself, and then I read the back. They've put Black Currant flavouring all through the chocolate, and it's in the jelly. So it's just fucking way too much. I'm giving that a 4 out of 10. Don't fucking bother. It does taste like Black Currant jellies, but times 10 with a little bit of chocolate. Too much.
