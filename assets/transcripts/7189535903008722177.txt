Right hungry Jax is back at it again with the blatant plagiarism this time. They're ripping off the bubblegum McFlurry But seriously check it out the Big Mac the Big Jack the bubblegum McFlurry the bubblegum storm And they haven't just stopped at Ronnie Mac. They've went after the colonel to KFC chicken burger JFC chicken burger mashies gravy tatoes This is how I feel with uber eats as logo fucking pisses me off, but do they do it as well as the OG's? Hey, could I try that new bubblegum yum-yum you've got down there? Yeah, no So this is what it looks like when I got it from the drive-thru It did not look like this when I got home It is that fucking hot hence the stubby cooler. It matches the photo lots of bubblegum syrup and fuck all marshmallows Let's do it. Make sure I got a fair few marshy's for this spoonful. I Reckon that's pretty fucking spot on a let's break it down the ice cream. They've improved a lot hungry Jackson their ice cream It's pretty good The bubblegum syrup is identical to the original bubblegum McFlurry syrup and the marshmallows are the same as the second bubblegum McFlurry release They're not like the original release where the fucking marshmallows went hard They were fucking awesome, but these are spot-ons of the second release, but there needs to be more of them So add more and this is an eight and a half out of ten But with the PC amount that I've got I'm gonna get to give it a seven out of ten
