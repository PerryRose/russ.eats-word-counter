Righto, Russ Eats Around The World Part 3, we're already returning to Ireland. I'm doing this because it's only 10 days from St. Patrick's Day, so Taste Ireland's hooked me up with some Irish treats to go with my Irish piss. Starting with the Cadbury Snack Sandwich, apparently it's from the UK but the Irish have claimed it. There it is, like a vanilla biscuit sandwich. 5 out of 10, the chocolate's yum but the biscuit's shit dry as. The Golden Crisp, 7 out of 10, the crunchy block's better. Black Jacks, apparently old geezers love these. That's like a licorice starburst chew. Club Rock Shandy, this is like Fanta and Solo with floaties. 9 out of 10, that's fucking amazing. Let's move on to some piss, starting with Bailey's Irish Cream. I don't even have to try this to tell you it's a 9 out of 10, especially with milk and ice, a fucking absolute treat. Moving on to Guinness, apparently there's a steak in every beer, the Irish equivalent to the man shake. 3 out of 10, that's shit piss and I hate that it's flat. I know it's supposed to be but it's fucking shit. The Kilkenny. That tastes like the King's Cup at the end of King of Beers, that's a 2 out of 10, filth and flat. 9 out of 10 for the Smith's Bacon Fries, they taste like crispy salty bacon fat. These Buffalo Hunky Dories are a 7.5 out of 10, they taste like Tasty Jacks. Sour Cream and Shemrock Irish Potato Chips, 6.5 out of 10, decent chip, decent flavour, nothing special. And finally, Irish Whiskey Barbecue. 8 out of 10, they're fucking mad.
