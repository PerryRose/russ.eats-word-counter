Righto, the Junk Food Graveyard Part 9, we're doing chips. Now, we have already seen three resuscitations from the Junk Food Graveyard this year. Tubes for fucking More Times Than Johnny Farnham, Burger Man and 3D Doritos. But, there's a few more I want to see resuscitated from the Graveyard, starting with Tasty Jacks. This range was fucking incredible. They were Arnott's branded and they were crinkle cut chips, but the crinkles were closer together. They were not ordinary potato chips, there was something about these, just trust me. Then, we've got Muncheros. Now, I never tried these, I don't even know if that's how you say it, but I get so many fucking messages about these, apparently they were fucking loose. Now, this Smith's release was an absolute treat. Bigger cheese, my favourite chip of all time and King's mustard. They also had a sauce one, it was alright, but these two were the way to go. While I'm on Smith's, quick shout out to the Vegemite Smith's, these were sick. Please tell me someone else remembers these Twisty's Corn Puffs. I was addicted to the melted butter ones. This was the only photo I could find. They also had a cheese one, they were like melt in your mouth balls of corn. I never had anything else like them. I've got to mention the OG Rich Chips. Now, they've tried to bring these back, they were fucking nothing like the originals. Honey Baked Ham, one of the best chips of all time and Herb and Spice. I was probably too young, it's a bit of like a dad chip, bit of a dad chip, so I can't comment on this, but a lot of people do and say it was sick. Honourable mention of the Big Cheese, you already know my feelings on this one, bring it back.
