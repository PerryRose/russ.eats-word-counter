Righto, Whittaker's Hot Cross Bun. I hope this block's okay. It was flaccid the other day. And it wasn't just me. This is a video from a Woolies. This made me so sad. Look at all that wasted chalk. I don't give a fuck about the Beast Chalk or really the Daryl Lee, but the rest made me sad. Let's do it. And it's still pretty fucking good. There's some marks where my hands had grabbed it when it was still soft, but that's still pretty much near perfect. Anyway, it has orange oil, mixed spice flavors and raisins. I don't know if there's orange oil even in Hot Cross Buns, but anyway. Okay, listen closely. When I first ate it, it was bang on. It was a Hot Cross Bun. It was missing like a toasted or a butter flavor, but it was a 9 out of 10. But then the orange oil hits and it just tastes like a fucking Jaffa. And a Hot Cross Bun and a Jaffa are completely separate, so I'm dropping it to a 7 because of that fucking orange oil. Piss it off.
