Righto, the Rust Not Eats The Bun Hunt continues. Iced Vovo Hot Cross Buns. Have a fucking look at them. This is a reminder, by the way. If your buns look like this, go see a fucking doctor. Okay, have a fucking look at them. They got white chocolate, raspberry fudge and jellies, and a little bit of coconut on the top. We're gonna do the plain one first with nothing on it. Okay, we're off to a good start. If plain with no butter is good, then this is gonna be fucking excellent. This is cold with butter and hot with butter. Fucking hell, I am speechless. That is fun. That is super sweet fucking raspberry up front, and then you get like the butter with the coconut and the fucking melted chocolate. That is a nine and a half out of ten. They are excellent.
