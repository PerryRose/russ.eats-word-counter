Righto, the new Hungry Jack's Burger Bites. Apparently it's beef and cheese, but that's a fucking poo. That's a deep fried poo. And because it looks like a fucking poo, I've had to update my Russ Eats Bristol stool chart. Screenshot that. If you're in this lower half, please get help. Metamucil, just talk to someone. Okay, that's what they look like. A lot smaller than I expected. Let's try one plain. Okay, it does kind of look like dog food. And I was about to complain that they gave me sweet and sour sauce when it's supposed to be ketchup, but it tastes like brown popcorn chicken. That's the only way I can describe it. For research, I will do it with the sweet and sour and tomato sauce though. Tomato. Okay, I'm not getting burger at all. Even with the tomato sauce and I did a bit of mustard, I'm still not getting that fucking burger taste. That is brown popcorn chicken. Okay, I can't. That is fucking brown popcorn chicken. I'm giving that a five and a half out of 10. They're oddly enjoyable, but it's brown popcorn chicken.
