Righto, Golden Gay Time Bites, little bite size ice creams. So quick price, $3.60 per 100ml, where normal gay times are $2.25 per 100ml. So these are not double, but fucking you're getting close to it. Anyway, I really don't know the point of these, but I've seen 47 calories per bite on the pack. So I'm assuming they're aimed at them people, pretty much like my girlfriend that thinks if you eat a full pack of Maltesers two at a time over a full day, it's somehow different to eating the full bag at once. So I'm assuming it's aimed at that target market. Let's give them a go. That's the size of them, pretty good size. Two bites at once, you're not going to do a full one at once, looks like a gay time inside. Pretty fucking good, let me go. Giving them a nine out of 10, something different, no one's done this before. It's just like a golden gay time, but with a way more chocolate ratio. So fucking good, give them a go.
