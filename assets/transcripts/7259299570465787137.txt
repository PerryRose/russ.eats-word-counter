Righto, Ultra Peachy Keen Sugar-Free Monster. Now I hate Original Monster, and you guys know that I don't like sugar-free energy drinks. So a sugar-free monster isn't something that would usually catch my eye. That is until you guys kept commenting, telling me to try the sugar-free monster range, and I gave in and used it fucking onto something. These are all, these are all pretty fucking good, especially this one. I can't believe that I actually choose to buy a sugar-free energy drink. They're the only ones that don't have that fucked aftertaste. Sugar-free Red Bull's one of the worst drinks on Earth. So I'm glad I'm not stubborn, and thank you for introducing me to them. Let's fucking go. I don't know how they do it, but that aftertaste is barely there. It makes that Rockstar that I had the other night look like an absolute piece of shit. That's an 8.5 out of 10. That is just nice and peachy, frosty cold, that's helping, and the aftertaste for a sugar-free drink, I'm impressed. I'm a converted man. Sugar-free monster, mmm.
