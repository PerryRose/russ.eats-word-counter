Right-o, Snackology episode 2, the Freddo Ice Cream Cake flavour. I was asked the other night, what flavour is the Freddo Ice Cream Cake, and even though I could taste it, I could taste it in my memory, I could not fucking answer what flavour this is. Since being asked this question, I haven't slept, it's honestly pissing me off. I'm trying to make out I'm some sort of snack expert, and I can't even tell you what fucking flavour the Freddo Ice Cream Cake is. So I thought, I'm gonna have to dive a little bit deeper, starting with the front of the packet. Triple A Ice Cream Cake, with real teeny Freddo Cadbury Dairy Milk, milk chocolate pieces. It doesn't say what flavour it is. It gets worse, the ingredients just say Ice Cream and Flavours, there's no mention of what flavour this fucking cake is. So I hit up Cadbury, and even they didn't know, they just fobbed me off to Peter's. So I have a 4 minute phone call with the bloke from Peter's, let's just call him Peter. Peter says to me it's Vanilla Flavour, then he says it's Freddo Flavoured, what the fuck's Freddo Flavoured? Then he says it's Dairy Milk Flavoured. Now, I'm actually at this point even more confused at what flavour this cake is. The only reference to a flavour online is on some Facebook page that has about 2 followers that says Caramel Flavoured. Which would really piss me off, like it pissed me off when I found out that these were Caramel Flavoured. At this point I've realised there's only one way to find out, and that's with a practical examination. Now I'm sorry if this ruins your childhood, but all 3 colours are definitely the one flavour, and that flavour I am 90% sure is cheap, plain old Vanilla Ice Cream. Peter's, we want answers.
