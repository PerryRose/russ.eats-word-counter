Righto, the forgotten foods of our childhood that still exist. I'm starting with Ice Magic. This was inspired by my junk food graveyard where I listed these three products where I was absolutely shocked to find out they still exist. These weren't dead, they were just forgotten. Now obviously some people haven't forgotten because it's still on the shelf, but I was going to put this in one of my junk food graveyards where it'd come up in stock at Coles and I nearly fucking sprinted there. If you have forgotten, let me rejig your memory. Here's some of the old flavours. It's literally a chocolate syrup for ice cream that turns hard. I thought this was some full Harry Potter level shit when I was younger. I fucking loved it. Now one of the rules of Ice Magic is you've got to have it with cheap as fuck vanilla ice cream. I actually couldn't find the scum of the earth Cole's shit. This was as cheap as I could go. Peter's is actually a little upper class from what I remember. Let's give it a go. It's time. Let's give it time to set. Alright, starting to go hard but still a little gooey. There you go. It's still a bit wet under there, but listen to that. Fucking that's hard. Let's see if it's as good as I remember. That's a yes. There's something about that egg. I don't care how fancy Ben and Jerry get, there's something about fucking Ice Magic on cheap vanilla ice cream that just wins. I've got to give that a 9 out of 10. It's exactly how I remember it. Please let me know if you forgot as well because I might be the only one.
