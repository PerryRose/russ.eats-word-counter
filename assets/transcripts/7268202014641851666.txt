Right, quickie tonight, bubblegum sticks and cola sticks. These have been out for a while, but I forgot to review them, so let's do both. Fun fact, these are the exact same as these sherbet fizzers above. In New Zealand, they came back as this, but in Australia, they came back as Lifesavers sticks. I love these, by the way. Apparently, the Lifesavers brand resonates more with the Australian market or some bullshit. Kicking off with the cola ones. Nah, the cola flavour tastes like a near-out-of-battery cola I get. The sherbet's nice, but the cola flavour is absolute fucking dogshit. And the bubblegum. Okay, so they taste super artificial. The disappointing part is the centre is sweet, it's not an actual sherbet, but the bubblegum flavour is exactly the same as the Bubblegum McFlurry, and I fucking love a Bubblegum McFlurry, so that's giving it some bonus points. Overall, I'm gonna give these a 6 out of 10, cola a fucking 3.
