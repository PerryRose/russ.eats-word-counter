Righto, Ned Brockman's Iced Coffee and Choccy Milk, the bloke's a legend. He ran from Perth to Sydney, I can't even run 3Ks without getting chafed, and every bottle raises money for the homeless. But this isn't The Voice, okay? You don't get any bonus points just because we like ya or your story, okay? If it's good, it's good. If it's shit, it's shit. Vice versa, if someone we didn't like brought out a drink, like Kim Jong-un, if he brought out an energy drink, I'd actually tell you if it's good, okay? That's how it works here. Kicking off with the Choccy Milk, it's a different target market to your regular milks. These are high protein, so for a fair comparison, I'm gonna do it side by side with the Oak Plus. We'll kick it off with that. And Ned's. Okay, I'm so glad it's good. I really didn't want to spray this product because of how fucking good of a person he is. It's fucking awesome. This has that classic Oak aftertaste. This is a lot sweeter, like a Choccy ice cream aftertaste. Both super smooth. I prefer this, 8 out of 10 for a protein milk. And the Iced Coffee, make sure you shake these two. They are so bad at the bottom if you don't. 7.5 out of 10. Super smooth, but a really mild coffee flavour. Similar to your Dare single espresso. And it says big caffeine hit, but doesn't actually say how much caffeine's in it. So Ned, if you're watching, please let us know how strong on the caffeine this is. Pretty good. I'm assuming you would have these after a jog, not before, because you'd have the squirts by kilometre one. So I think that's how it works, but what the fuck would I know?
