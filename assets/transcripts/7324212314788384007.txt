Righto, the Iced Latte Twirl, I'm a massive Twirl fan. Now the flake without all the fucking mess. I don't know why Macca's doesn't switch from the flakes in their soft serves to a twirl. It'd be way better. The only logical explanation to why they haven't switched is that they like seeing their customers in pain as their kids put fucking flake all over the back seat of the car. Now behind me are the recent efforts of Twirl. The Honeycomb Sundae, we had a sus aftertaste. Loved the strawberry. The rest were pretty fucking good too. Anyways, let's go. Okay, the iced coffee flavor is exactly the same as this, but this is way better. Just like the Honeycomb Sundae, it's almost like a chemical taste. Like way too much, like an overdose of flavoring. So I'm only going to give it a 6 out of 10. It's pretty good, but there's something weird about it once again. I don't know what's going on, Twirl. Have a look into that, okay? Please.
