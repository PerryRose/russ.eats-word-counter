Righto, season 2, the hunt for festive piss continues. I know you're thinking it's a bit early in November to start the hunt, but fuck me. Kmart had decorations up about 3 months ago, so let me start the hunt early. And, I am full of Christmas cheer. We've already got the tree up. And it's a Saturday night, I also want to be full of piss, so let's get on with it. Forgot to introduce the product, Christmas Pudding Bundy Rum. I love a little bit of pud. Even got this book about pud written by my Aunty Donna. Let's get straight into it. So it's notes of raisins, brown sugar, mixed spices, vanilla and brandy. Let's go. Okay, you taste rum up front, but that tastes exactly like a plum pudding. I don't fucking mind that at all. It's only 20%, so it's super sweet. But, rum on Christmas is a fucking bad idea. You'll headbutt your mum by lunch. This is not the festive piss of choice, but what it is, this is like a dessert festive piss. Once you're absolutely fuck-eyed, you've had all the food, you've eaten about a million prawns, and then there's a couple of stragglers still hanging around, like Uncle Tony, he's still there. This is what you'd rip out and have a little one over the rocks. I think that's what this will be for Christmas.
