Righto, the return of the gravy chip. Now, I don't know if you all remember this, but back in 2008, Hamish and Andy on the radio did like a big poll of what flavour chip everyone wanted. Everyone voted for gravy, they brought them out in limited batches, and I remember them going for fucking heaps on eBay, and then they brought them out anyway, so if you spent like a thousand bucks on a pack, you were basically a fucking idiot. Then they came back a few years later as the AFL gravy chip. I didn't really get this, like we have pizza and beer with NRL, so I know people from Melbourne are weird as fuck, so I don't know if you have gravy with your AFL, but please let me know if you do. Let's do it. I'm getting like a barbecue smell, which is pretty much what I expected, and what I remember. Not bad. I'm giving them a 7.5 out of 10, because they've nailed the flavour, but it's not hard to nail the flavour, you just gotta put some fucking gravy stock on a chip, really. It's a barbecue chip experience, so it tastes like a barbecue chip, but with this gravy, fish and chip shop gravy aftertaste. So if you like barbecue, and you like gravy, give these a go.
