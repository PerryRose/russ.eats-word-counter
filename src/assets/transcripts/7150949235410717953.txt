Righto, we've got the new Aero Orange Block. Now, Aero doesn't get the attention it deserves. These are the OG flavours, the mint and the chocolate, and they did a caramel gold one last year which was fucking awesome. Cadbury also did an Aero rip-off a couple of years ago, it was alright, but the OG always wins. Now when you don't come out with many flavours, I feel like orange is a weird choice. There's such a niche flavour like mint choc with a cult following. These are some of the big orange chocolates, I don't mind it to be honest. Got a real strong orange smell. Holy shit. Fuck, that looks alright. Let's do it. I forgot how good fucking Aero is. It melts in your mouth so much because of all the bubbles. That's like a stronger orange than a Jaffa, but pretty good. I fucking don't mind that. I'm going to have to give that a 7.5 out of 10, Aero's mad.
