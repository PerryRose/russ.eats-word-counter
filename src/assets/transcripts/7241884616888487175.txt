Righto, the new Juneberry flavoured Red Bull, summer edition, in winter. Once again, they're too lazy to change their cans for Australia, where the seasons are obviously the opposite. At least they got the month right, though. I will apologise, I did talk shit about all of the past Red Bull releases and I got some absolute backlash. I was a bit harsh. Most of them are actually okay, and their last two releases I thought were pretty fucking good. So let's see if we can go for the hat trick. Also, I had to Google what a Juneberry tastes like. Apparently it tastes like a dark cherry or raisin, and is generally milder than blueberries, so there you go. They also go where blueberries can't, which sounds pretty fucking sus. Let's do it. That's fucking mad. That's one of the best yet, in my opinion. Also, it's 8 o'clock, I'm gonna be absolutely fucking pinging after this. I've made a big mistake. This tastes like Starburst Chews Cherry, so if you like that cherry flavour, you'll love this. But it's not as intense, not as medicine-like, and it's got like a blueberry aftertaste. I fucking love it. I'm gonna give that an 8 out of 10, a little treat. If you like cherry, get around it.
