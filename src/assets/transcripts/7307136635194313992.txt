Righto, this is huge, an absolute honour. You would have seen in my Maximus Zero ad where I called out the fact that all the ads for these kinds of drinks pretend to be aimed at athletes, when 95% of the people that drink them are like me and you, regular fucking people. So Maximus hit me up to do a real ad, none of that fake shit you see on TV, and I'm gonna show you some real Maximus moments. Moment number 1, you've just remembered the green bin goes out tomorrow, and if you don't cram a fortnight's worth of yard work into the next 3 hours, you're gonna be absolutely fucked. So what is wrong with my hedge? Next will be you in about a month, you went way too hard the night before and you forgot about Christmas at Nana's, you've had about 2 hours sleep and the only thing keeping you alive is this Maximus, about 3 prawns and a Lynx Africa kit. Next is when you spend more time cleaning the fucking pool than you do swimming in it. Don't get a pool, get a friend with a pool, okay? Next I wanna give a quick shoutout to the frozen Maximus, these are an Australian icon that save lives every summer, they also save your fucking food because they act as an ice brick in your esky. Genius. And I know I said I'm not an athlete, but I've had to give it a go lately, ever since I've started, you know, reviewing snacks every night of my fucking life. I earned this one, I was like Harry Potter reaching for the golden snitch at this stage, I nearly died.
