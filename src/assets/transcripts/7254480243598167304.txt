Righto, the new Biscoff Shake and Storm from Hungry Jacks. There's a lot of hype around this one and I agree, it looks naughty, but does it taste naughty? I'll get the biscuit milk and the frozen biscuit. Here's a close-up of the shake and here's a close-up of the storm. Looks pretty good. Kicking it off with the biscuit milk. Nah, I knew something was off and I've just rang Hungry Jacks and had it confirmed. It is not a Biscoff flavoured shake. It is a vanilla shake with Bickey crumb and Biscoff topping. And you don't get any of the topping through the fucking straw. So it is just a Bickey milk. Complete disappointment. I'm giving that a 4 out of 10. Yes, it is quite nice, but it's not a Biscoff shake and that's what I wanted. Now the storm. Now I know this is just vanilla ice cream, but I knew that from the beginning, which is why I'm not going to be as let down when I try this. Exactly what I expected. Eight and a half out of 10. The best part is you're in control of exactly how much Bickey and topping you get with each spoonful. It's not whatever fucking decides to go up the straw like this, dog. Can't complain there. I'm happy.
