Righto, I've got a message from Twisty saying they've got a new product that's a bit smelly and I was thinking like Cernstrong or Blue Cheese, but they're fucking candles. Have a look at this. And it comes in little Twisty's matches. They smell so fucked up, I don't know if I can smell them through the packaging. I don't know. Okay, so this is the Chicken Twisty. It is a fucking Chicken Twisty candle and smells exactly like one. Let's do the cheese. The cheese and the Chicken Twisty, it smells like when you open like a parmesan cheese. I'm not burning that. I'm sorry, I can't do that to my house.
