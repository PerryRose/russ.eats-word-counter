Righto, the Russ Eats Cocktail School, a brand new segment where I turn my favourite treats into piss. This is not for the exquisite fancy pants cocktail drinkers, this is for the filth bags, the junk food lovers, and I'm turning the Sour Patch Watermelon into some piss. Let's do it. Here's the recipe. I'll even tell you how much it costs and the standard drinks. 15ml of Contreau, 15ml of Red Cordial, just use any Red Cordial, 45ml of Watermelon Liquor, this is where the magic is. I got mine from Dan Murphy's. Then any old lemon juice, fresh lemon juice is better, but mine were mouldy as fuck. Shake it up, you know how it goes. Next we decorate it. Now this you don't have to do, but if you want to get fancy and show off, rim it with some sour goo you get from the cheap shops, then rip open a bag of Whiz Fizz, you don't need to microwave the plate, chop it up with your closest card, mine was the Booper one. Then this actually didn't work very well by the way, I don't really recommend the Whiz Fizz. Couple of ice cubes, then tip it out and have a fucking look at that. I didn't forget the final touches, a human centipede of Sour Patch Kids and it's not a cocktail without a cock. The moment of truth, cheers. I promise ya, if you love sour shit like Sour Warheads and you have dentistry on your health insurance you will fucking love this. I'm a bit biased because I made it, but it's a fucking 9 out of 10, ultimate twang.
