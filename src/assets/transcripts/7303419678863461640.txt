Righto, a Kim Kardashian flavoured energy drink, Kime. This is the Alani brand of energy drinks that I haven't tried. I have no idea what Kim Kardashian's supposed to taste like and I've actually never wondered. Anyways, I can't believe that she has an energy drink. It just doesn't make sense to me because in my opinion, energy drinks are targeted at blokes that punch walls and chicks that punch Siggy's. It would make more sense for a Fred Durst energy drink or Courtney Love. But anyway, this is proof that energy drinks are starting to move more into like the pre-workout market. They're starting to take over. It's a whole new category targeting a new audience of fit people, which yeah, it just doesn't make sense for energy drinks that are like, give you basically kidney stones. So I'm a bit of a noob in this category. So bear with me. Okay, I forgot to mention it's a sugar-free energy drink. So it's got a little bit of that aftertaste, but it's not bad at all. It's just a pink lemonade flavour. If you know what that flavour is, that's this slight tang. I don't know what I was expecting Kim Kardashian to taste like, but it wasn't pink lemonade. Please comment below what you think Kim Kardashian should have tasted like. Seven and a half out of 10, not bad. I'm not gonna finish it though. These pre-workout drinks make your fucking face itch if they've got that shit in it. I'll let you know in the comments if it's got that shit.
