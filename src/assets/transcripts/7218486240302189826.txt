Right-o, the new Caramilk ice cream. Now, I know I promised I'd get off Caramilk's dick, and I have, so I'm not overhyping it anymore, but this is 12 bucks for a pissy little container, so I'm just gonna let you know if you should waste your money on it. Also, can someone tell Thornton Coles to fix their fucking freezer? Nothing turns me off more than seeing this. We're paying 12 bucks a pop. We don't want it to look like fucking Jasper off The Simpsons. For you people that don't have culture, this is Jasper. Let's dive deep into the Caramilk core. The spoon kind of goes straight through and then you pull out, like, a thick sludge of Caramilk. It looks pretty fucking good. Let's do it. That's not doing it for me, eh? It's super one-dimensional in flavour. Like, it's just sweet. The little Caramilk flakes throughout it are quite nice, but other than that, it's pretty fucking plain. I'm giving that a 5 out of 10. It's not worth the 12 bucks. Stick to a couple of bottles of Ice Magic and about 10 litres of Coles brand French vanilla for the same fucking price.
