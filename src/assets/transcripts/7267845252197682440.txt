Righto, the Ice Coffee Breakaway, my first review in ages, I apologise, I've been fucking flat out and I haven't even been home in 10 days, here's a quick summary. My sister got married, don't be a rude cunt and drop a congrats in the comments. Then Demi broke her pinky toe kicking it on the door while picking up my undies, so I heard about that, don't you worry. Then we went to Beechworth for the Twister launch, I'll be doing an update on this in a few weeks, you fucking wait. And now I'm straight back into it, so let's not fuck around. Breakaway Ice Coffee, the Breakaway Rangers made a massive comeback. This is how I remember it, and then it was discontinued. It then returned as a Bicky, which pissed me off. Then a couple of years ago, made its way back to blocks, the standout has been the Caramilk Breakaway, second treat of the year last year. They've also got the Breakaway Twirl, which is a timeout, I don't know if I've mentioned that before, but it is a timeout. Let's do it, it's fucking thick. Yeah, okay, so first impressions was it smelt like a mug of Mocona, like old man coffee breath, but it didn't taste like it. It was more like an ice break ice coffee, and the perfect balance of chocolate to coffee with the wafer. Once again, that is proof that Breakaway is a god tier block. I'm giving that an 8 out of 10, I can definitely fuck with this. If you like coffee, and you like wafer, and you like chocolate, get into it.
