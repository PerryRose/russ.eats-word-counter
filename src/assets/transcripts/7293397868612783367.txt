Righto, it's that time of year where a heap of milks drop and I'm kicking it straight off with the Caramel Coffee Oak. Now, Oak has had so many spin-offs around caramel-inspired flavours. Caramel Popcorn, Fantails, Chiquito, Whiteshot Caramel, Aaron's Caramel, Rainbow Paddle Pop and the Max Molten Caramel. With coffee, there hasn't been as many spin-offs. We've got the normal iced coffee, of course, Mocha, and Strong Iced Coffee. The Strong Iced Coffee was good, but it will never beat the Strong Farmer's Union Iced Coffee that you can only get in South Australia. Fucking bring that to New South Wales, please. Let's do it. Also, this is a re-release. It came out in 2016 as a 7-Eleven exclusive, but I never tried it. Okay, so this literally is just a 50-50 mix of these two. It's like they have leftover stock and just mashed them together. No product innovation here. It just feels very effortless. And they're kind of fighting with each other. The caramel overpowers the coffee, then the coffee overpowers the caramel. So overall, it's quite an underwhelming flavour. If you wanted caramel, buy that. If you wanted coffee, buy that. I'm giving it a 5 out of 10. I'm just a bit disappointed, okay?
