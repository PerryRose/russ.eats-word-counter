Righto, the new Y3000 flavoured Coke Zero. This has been co-created with AI. This is also the first Coke creations to hit Australia. We've had Starlight, Dreamworld, Ultimate and Move in America and I think a couple of others. Now I thought I'd have a bit of fun with this and ask AI what they would create as a Coke flavour and then see if this matches it, where the first result I got was a hint of vanilla where I said that is already a flavour you fucking dumb cunt. I then said one that hasn't been done before. No fruits, chocolate, vanilla, cinnamon, mint or chilli where they said coffee fucking Coke. Which once again already existed and was one of the filthiest most fucked up Cokes I've ever tasted in my life. Enough stuffing around, let's get into it. Also, if you're a food technologist, you should be watching nervously because if this is good, you're fucked. You better start polishing up your resume. Okay, this is fucking hard. I finished the whole can trying to figure out what it tastes like. It's supposed to taste like the future but I reckon it tastes like a Coke Zero mixed with a Fairy Floss Zoopa Doopa, maybe a bit of a creamy caramel aftertaste. It's okay, I'm going to give it a 7 out of 10. It's nothing special, I wouldn't be time travelling to the future for any time soon if this is all I've got.
