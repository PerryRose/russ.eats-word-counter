Right now, I've just kicked off the eats the bun hunt, and you fuckwits in the comments are starting shit already because I microwaved my bun. So I ask you, what is the best way to do your hot cross bun? Obviously, it's gonna have butter. If you don't put butter on it, you're a fuckwit, but I'm gonna do air fryer, microwave, grill, toaster, and just fucking cold, and I'm gonna give you my opinion, but let me know what you think. Kicking it off with the microwave. This, to me, is the OG way. The texture is a bit sog, but I like it. The butter spread is shit. That's the biggest letdown. Very hot sometimes, but not complex at all. You don't forget about it, easy to clean. Then we've got the grill. I fucking hate the grill. The complexity's high, because you gotta wait for it, and then you gotta clean it, and then it always burns one side when you forget about it. I lost the bun here to the bun lords. The butter ability was gorgeous. Awesome texture. It wasn't too hard, not too soft. Did enjoy. Next, we've got it straight from the packet. They have to be fresh from this. I know it's not a cold cross bun, but sometimes it hits the spot with that extra thick, cold butter. This was okay, okay? Low complexity, okay, shit texture. Next, we've got the sandwich press. This is what we used to do in McCafe. Texture's shit. It looks like a piece of fucking roadkill, but look at that even cook. The butter ability is perfect, but the complexity's high. You gotta wait for it to cool down, then you forget to put it away, then you get yelled at because you fucking left the toaster on the bench, so it's a no from me. Last but not least, the air fryer. Complexity depends if you leave it on your bench or not. I don't, so it was high complexity. Texture was shit. It was hard as a fucking rock. Butter ability was shit too. For everyone that talked this up, I'm not a fan, sorry, and I only did two minutes.
