Righto, the new fiery zinger burger, wish they called it the ring zinger, and we have the fiery double. This is making me clench. This is a part of the new spicy zinger range in Rising Spice, the fiery being the final boss. Fast food burgers, however, have a habit of claiming to be five alarm when they're only ever three alarm chili. We want to fucking hallucinate. We want it that hot that we cry and shit. Cry and shit everywhere. Let's have a look at them. The double has bacon, cheese, supercharged, and fiery sauce, where this one's just a normal zinger with fiery sauce instead. Start with the burger. I'll get a real saucy bit. Okay, that's about a four alarm. It's kind of right at the peak of when I stop enjoying chili flavors. Really nice chili flavor, slightly sweet. I'm gonna give that an eight and a half. Pretty fucking good. And the double. Actually, it's good. Seven out of ten. That one's a bit full on, where this was more of a rounded burger and the chili really came through. It didn't squirt on me, but it was a lot hotter. This one, it's a squirter, but not as hot. Use that for your Tinder bio.
