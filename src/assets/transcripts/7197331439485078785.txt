Righto, as you know Red Rooster has picked up their game focusing on what we really want fried chicken instead of fucking baked dinners Anyway, they have brought out a new hot honey flavor and there is a reason I'm so keen for this And that's because I went to this fried chicken place called Garmi in Melbourne and it was just fucked up good It was just chicken and beer and I had this honey chicken and this spicy chicken and this is hot honey chicken So I feel like it's gonna be a combination of both The best thing about Red Rooster is they only serve about four customers a day So look at this fucking ghost town. I'm so eating it straight in the drive-thru Hey, can I please get two pieces of the fried chicken honey, sorry the fried honey chicken Quick unboxing it doesn't look like a heap of honey, but it looks pretty fucking good. Let's do it. That looks fucking gorgeous That Is fucking beautiful the sweet the salty and the spice just works so fucking well If there was more honey on it and a bit more hate I'd give this a nine and a half out of ten I'm gonna drop it to an eight and a half. Give it a fucking go. This is mad
