Righto, the new Sour Blueberry Bilsons. Now this has been in my fridge for a week, but as you know I caught Giardia or whatever it is and the doctor gave me strict instructions not to drink any alcohol at all and I've went through enough undies, I wasn't risking another shot, so I fucking listened. Now when I was at Bilsons they told me that this was coming and that's why I steered clear of the kablooey flavour, but kablooey is blue raspberry, this is sour blueberry, so I don't know if I wasn't listening or they got it wrong, but this is actually a surprise to me. I thought it was blue raspberry. Anyways, let's do it. Okay, I've literally finished the can trying to put my finger on something super familiar and I finally cracked it, green V. This tastes and smells like green V up front, but then you get like a blue raspberry brain liquor aftertaste. I don't reckon it's blueberry at all, it's still an eight and a half, it's a fucking tangy little treat, but it is not blueberry, it's blue raspberry. For your info, I went deep on this, I was thinking maybe original V is blueberry flavour, that's where all this confusion is coming from, but I gave up after it was describing metallic or bitter, salty or sharp, and then I realised they were describing Vigina, Vigina, not V. There you go, had enough.
