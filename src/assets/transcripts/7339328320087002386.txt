Righto, the hunt for a palatable servo coffee is about to commence. Last time we had a coffee snob and a bogan, and this time we have a special guest who is somehow both. Have you had a servo coffee in a while? He was born in a servo, but he hasn't had a servo in a while. I don't know if they still do, but they used the same beans as Macca's back in the day. You've served me a few times before, actually. There we are. We've arrived at our first destination, 7-Eleven, which is Sportsbet favourites takeout number one. I've left my glasses on, so people aren't going to think I'm cool. We have to do it again. I'm too early for pit biking. You know there's an Instagram page called Servo Sunsets, and he just goes, Your wallet? That's the oldest trick in the book. Oh, that's not a good angle. So yeah, we have to go, bring that up and down. Yeah, there we go. The chin is gone. You do it yourself here. Yeah, I'm the barista. There is a trick. We're not going to do it because it is stealing. I'm not going to do it. I wouldn't do the trick. If you press the large button, let the milk go down the drain, and then put it under, you get a double shot coffee. At the same time. I wouldn't do it. He goes a flat white, I go a piccolo. What do you want? Yeah, I'll go a piccolo. So there is no piccolos. Oh wait, there is a piccolo. Oh, he says choice of milk. Oh, seen that recently. There's crema. The crema, I like that. It's not as bad as I thought. How much is this? They were a dollar, they just went up to two. Putting choccy on a piccolo. I always do it. What the fuck is that? You know what a magic is. No? Do many people order magic? Wizards? Wizards? Melbourne? Melbourne? Should we take this to the car park? I don't want to feed on a mouse. Cookie man, cookies for full effect. 7-Eleven's never really had a toilet that's publicly accessible. They give you that key. Yeah. You know the servo key? It's like usually something weird attached to the key. It's filthy. It is filthy. The mine's actually pretty good. Keep in mind, we've taken out the human error. And that's really where Macca's and Hungry Jack's fuck up. Sustainable coffees, apparently. Let's go. Hot, there's heat. It's hot. I'm not telling you to steal and do the double shot trick. But that could do with a double shot. I don't want to do it. Actually, wait. There's nothing unpleasant about mine. Because it's milk, right? Hence why I need the extra shot. But they've got a strong one, so I'm going to have a sip. I've got a cold sore, is that alright? I don't want to drink anything. I feel like I've chewed into a lemon. He told me you're called the mullet lord because you love fishing. Yeah, that's nice. It is sour. Burnt at the same time. That's still better than all three. Better than Macca's, Hungry Jack's and Goosbun. Goosbun was palatable. Macca's and Hungry Jack's wasn't palatable. That was sour. If you were on the road and there was nowhere else... You'd be okay. Can you throw down the hatch just for the effect? I really don't think you would actually do that. You own a fucking coffee shop with really good coffee. It was two bucks. It's actually cheaper than water in there. Water's $8.90. How much did you guys pay at Macca's? $5 at Macca's. So two bucks. And a better coffee. Eh? But it'll do. That's it. They're a bit snobby, man, but I'm easier to please. Here, let's double shot it. Yeah. With the extra shot, I'm telling you, that's palatable. That's okay. They're getting blueberries and camembert. I'm giving this a three. We don't give them ratings. We just say palatable or not palatable. It's palatable. It's Rush palatable. It's me on a... If you said Goosbun was palatable... It's me on a good day. It might be polite, but it's not palatable. Okay. Do you tip your coffee down the drain? You don't throw all the liquid in the bin? You are such a good role model, Wes. So the mullet lord's being caught getting a 7-Eleven coffee, which is the Newcastle coffee equivalent of Gordon Ramsay going through fucking Macca's drive-thru. I had one sip. I feel like I'm fucking on cloud nine, eh? Anyway, we are heading to BP Wild Bean Cafe to flick the bean. Let's go.
