Righto, we've got buns, hun. The first bun in the Rust.EatsTheBunHunt is the Fairy Bread Hot Cross Bun. I don't know what I think about this. Okay, so it's a plain bun with funfetti, which I thought was mold, and you get a pack of sprinkles. So you gotta fucking do it yourself. I'm doing one in the microwave, and then I'm doing one cold, because fairy bread is cold. I feel like I'm gonna have to do that. So if you have a look here, butter on, oh like a fucking decent slob, you know that. And then you've got to put the sprinkles on yourself. I do feel a bit ripped off that I'm having to provide the labor here, but they do look kind of fun. I think kids might like this. Anyway, let's go. Okay, I'm gonna have one by itself just to see if there's anything special in the actual bun. No, that's a fucking bread roll. That's like a KFC dinner roll. Fucking hell. There's nothing special about that. Okay, cold one first, and the hot one. That's a fucking scam. Save yourself some money and buy a loaf of fucking bread the old-fashioned way. It's literally a bread roll. There's nothing special about it. The warm one was filthy too, by the way. It was like fairy bread that's been out in the park for a first birthday for a couple of hours. That's, I don't know, two out of ten. It is fucking disappointing and a little bit embarrassing to be honest.
