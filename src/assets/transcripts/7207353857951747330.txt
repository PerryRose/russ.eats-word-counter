Righto, the Rustot Easter Egg Hunt continues with the Ferrero Rocher egg. Now I lashed out, this was 15 bucks, but that gorgeous golden egg caught my eye, and there's a reason I love golden eggs. And that's because a golden egg symbolises when my least favourite fictional character, Veruca Sol, she's a little fucking bitch. I hated her, it reminds me of this exact moment. When she finally got what she deserved, that entitled little bitch, and fell down the egg chute and died. Well, I don't know if she died, apparently she was eliminated, but I like to think that she died. Okay, I've just opened it up and I'm not fucking happy. The golden egg is just a fake bit of plastic. You'd think for 15 bucks I could lash out on some fucking gold foil. That's all it is, is an egg in a bit of plastic. Fucking hell, let's go. There's a close-up, it's just a chocolate egg with hazelnuts. Okay, so the chocolate is super nice, but it's not a Ferrero Rocher, it's just hazelnut chocolate. It's missing that Nutella centre that the Ferrero Rochers have. Now, it's $15 and it comes with an egg and three fucking Ferrero Rochers. Save yourself two bucks and get a 30-pack from Coles for $13. I'm giving this a 5 out of 10, purely because of the economical value.
