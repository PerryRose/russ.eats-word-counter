Righto, we've got the fourth and fifth release of the inner biscuit comeback cheeseburger and smoky meatlovers Starting with meatlovers fair bit of flavoring on them, and they smell like fake-ass bacon Mmm. I really like them. They're not meatlovers at all They're kind of like the crispy bacon meets Pizza Hut or you can eat bacon chips. I really like them I'm gonna give them an 8 out of 10. I'm deducting points though because it's not smoky meatlovers at all It's smoky bacon now cheeseburger. They smell like a fucking Macca's gherkin so bad They are fucked they're one of the saddest biscuits I've ever had It's just all pickle no cheeseburger and the driest like fucking cat food shit Nah, 2 out of 10. Don't get them
