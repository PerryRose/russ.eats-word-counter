Righto, the first review of the year, we're coming in hot with the Kinder Tronky. Now I'm a massive Kinder fan, I'm a little bitch for a bueno, I smash them on the reg, they're a god tier choccy, but these happy hippos blew my mind when they came out about a year and a half ago. If you haven't tried them, you fucking gotta. These Tronkys look similar, that's why I'm so keen. Now the Tronky product isn't new, it's been out since 1987 overseas. The only difference is these were filled with Ferrero shit, where this one's filled with Kinder shit. Little unboxing, now the beauty of this chocolate is on days like today where it's about 35 fucking degrees, it doesn't melt on your fingers. I am getting some slight slippage from the melt, but other than that, it's fucking holding its shape. Quick look at the guts, now I reckon it does match the photo, you've got the chocolate layer at the top there, the creamy filling with the biscuit pieces and the wafer around the outside. Let's go. Alright. Instant Corinthian wafer stick vibes, imagine these filled with Kinder shit. The one from the fridge by the way was so much better, I reckon some people might be disappointed though. I personally think these are a god tier nana's treat, but some people fucking hate them. So I'm going to give it a 6.5 out of 10, I don't think it's near as good as other Kinder shit, but if you like these, like I do, you'll fucking love it.
