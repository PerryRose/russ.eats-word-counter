Righto, the Tostitos restaurant style chips, the first time reviewing this brand. I have tried their cantina style before, this splash of lime flavour is fucking gorgeous by the way. But I'm most keen to try these because they're claiming restaurant style and the only other restaurant style chip on the market are the mission chips and these are fucking hot. And what I mean about fucking hot is that they've got girth, they don't turn to a soggy mess when you make nachos, they've got a good thickness about them those mission chips, so I'm expecting the same from these. Smoked chipotle and sour cream, let's go. Nah, no girth, I forgot to mention, same owners as Doritos and they are literally just repackaged fucking Doritos. If I got served them in a restaurant, I'd headbutt the fucking waiter, they are just a repackaged Dorito, that's pissed me off. The mild Mexican salsa. Nah, exact same as the other ones, a fucking scam, they're an okay chip but I feel like they've just tried to pull the wool over my eyes and I don't like that, so fuck off.
