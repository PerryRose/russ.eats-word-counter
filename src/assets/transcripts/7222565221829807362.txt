Right, hey, New Marvelous Creations, Pascal Lollibag, there's not gonna be much motivation in this video. I've one of the worst hangovers I've ever fucking had. I haven't went out. I haven't went out in ages. And I'll tell you what, I hate having to pretend that I'm having fun while listening to Nicki Minaj's Starships and fucking Chris Brown Yeah, three times. It makes me sick. I'm only doing this video to fill in the time while Demi gets me a filthy Guzman burrito. Anyway, let's do it. There's clinkers, raspberry chips, and beanies in this, which are like Smarties, but I misread it as heenie, which reminded me of this, the heenie, the single best piece of fashion that we will ever see in our lifetimes. Bring it back. A rip curl heenie is one of the sexiest things anyone can wear. Let's do it. Looks pretty fucking good in the middle. Six out of ten, it's pretty good, but the clinkers just overpower it and it literally just tastes like this fucking block.
