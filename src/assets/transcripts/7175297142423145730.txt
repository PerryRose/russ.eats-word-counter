Righto. Once upon a time, Gloria Jeans dominated the coffee scene. They were the Australian Starbucks. But, lately I've seen more and more stores close down and I think it's because their coffee's fucking shit. Anyway, I'll always respect them because they're the inventor of the mocha voltage. So we're going to do a Russ Eats Creations how to make one of my favourite drinks of all time with just a Macca's chocolate frappe and a couple of shots of espresso. Um, just a large chocolate frappe with whipped cream. A large what, sorry? Chocolate frappe. Yeah, with no whipped cream. Now it's not fucking rocket science. I choose to use my own coffee at home. One shot for a medium, two shots for a large. You can just get the espresso from Macca's but it is even fucking worse than Gloria Jeans. It's absolute trash. Now they've stitched me out with half the cup empty but this is where the magic happens. I don't know what it is about this stage. You use the natural cup moisture to massage the espresso shot through. It's a bit sus. Hopefully there's enough natural lubrication from the condensation. And there's something about this part where it just, it just kind of goes, I don't know how to describe it but this, oh, I love this. I fucking, this is what makes it. Anyway, that's how you make the voltage. Let's give it a go. That is gorgeous. The best part is the coffee melts the ice. So it's just like a freezing cold ice coffee rather than a frappe. This is a nine out of ten. You'll be missed, Gloria. You'll be missed.
