Righto, I have the honor of breaking some news for Violet Crumble, hence the formal attire. Later this month, they are dropping a new Violet Crumble flavor. Now here's the catch, I have this experimental clear plastic bag. Usually I would recommend not trying anything experimental from a clear plastic bag, but here we fucking are. I'm allowed to try it, but I can't tell you what it is. I'm sorry, okay? That's just what the fucking catch is. First person to guess will be given something fucking huge though. And by huge, I mean maybe a heap of Violet Crumble or maybe a Fart in a Jar. I haven't actually got approval for a giveaway yet, but I'm excited. And yes, that was a Big Kev reference. May he rest in peace. I also want to mention, Men's has a habit of reviving Aussie icons. Not Big Kev, but the Violet Crumble was revived in 2018. And since then, they have delivered all this crumble. Plus a few cheeky collabs. And there's rumors they're going to do all this again for the Pollywaffle. I have asked, but they know I will leak it, so they haven't told me shit. Anyways, let's try this mystery crumble. They've told me to be honest too, okay? And I'm going to give away a couple of hints so you can win that Fart in a Jar. Looks exactly the same. Okay, that's easy. All I'm going to say is that you will love or hate it. If you see this flavor on the packaging, you will know if you like it. And it's fucking spot on. It is a Violet Crumble with that flavoring infused through it. And it works. Flavored Honeycomb, I think is the future.
