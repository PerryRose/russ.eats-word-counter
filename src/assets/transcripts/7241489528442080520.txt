Righto, the Cadbury Triple Decker. Please, if you googled this, spell it right. I did accidentally triple dicker. Yeah, the tip wasn't good. Now, instead of three cocks, when I finally spelt it right, I was met with these three blocks. The triple deckers that have been out in the past. This top right one is obviously the one I'm re-reviewing, the mint one. I remember it in this exact packaging. They've also had Caramel Triple Decker and Raspberry Triple Decker in the past. And a few years ago, they did this Neapolitan that was three layers. This is one of the best blocks I've ever had. Fucking loved it. There it is. Dairy milk on the bottom. You've got dream on the top. And then you've got a mint chalk, not chocolate. Remember what I taught you a few videos ago in the center. Smells exactly like an aero mint. So if you like aero, I feel like you'll like this. Yeah, that is a dense aero bar. An aero bar without 50% fucking air. Sometimes you don't want chocolate with all the goo and little bits through it. You just want the fucking old-fashioned texture of good old fucking chocolate. And that's what this is giving you. If you like the taste of an aero and you like old-fashioned fucking chocolate, you'll love this. I'm giving this a 9 out of 10 compared to other mint chocolates.
