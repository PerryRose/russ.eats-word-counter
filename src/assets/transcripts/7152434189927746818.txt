Righto, we've got the new Vanilla Slice flavoured classic. I apologize about my voice, I sound a bit like Darren Lockyer I've had a big weekend alright, so bear with me. So behind me You've got all the past releases of classic over the last couple of years They've been accurate flavors, but I haven't rated them as highly as oak. I did some research, and it's as simple as sugar There's about 15 to 25 percent less sugar in classic compared to the oak equivalent, so that's probably why I am pretty keen on this, something different. Vanilla Slice sounds like a pretty interesting flavor And it should be pretty fucking simple to pull off. It's just vanilla custard and pastry flavoring. Let's go This is interesting, I cannot put my finger on what it tastes like. I've gotten through two-thirds of the milk Just it's pissing me off. It tastes like something else. It's got custard and it's got pastry, but it's not a vanilla slice I'm leaning towards a Baker's Delight custard tea cake, but this is really pissing me off Please try this and let me know what it tastes like because it's so distinct Six out of ten, close enough to a vanilla slice. I guess it's something different It's fun, but it's annoying and I probably wouldn't buy it again
