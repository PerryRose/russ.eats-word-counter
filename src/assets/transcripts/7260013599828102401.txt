Righto, the Cinnamon Donut Donut King Twisty's Quick Story About Dumpster Donuts. Back when I was like 16, we used to hang around Donut King right as it closed to get free donuts because they used to just throw them out, and I'm a little bitch for a long john. Anyway, we never bought donuts so I think they got over it, so they just started throwing them into the dumpster. Anyways, that didn't stop us, we'd follow them to the dumpster and dive in it and then go up the skate park and eat them while drinking goon. Am I ashamed? Yeah, heaps. Let's do it. Oh yeah, they smell very cinnamony. Okay, so up front you get that Donut King donut, it's almost buttery, but then you get like a salty aftertaste which is catching me by surprise. Just like the raspberry ones, I'm fucking confused, but these are definitely better. I don't mind them, but I'm also not sure. Six to play it safe, six.
