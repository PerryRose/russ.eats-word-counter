Righto, Chicken Teriyaki Subway Smiths Chips. Now, your sub says a lot about you. Smashed falafel, hipster, loves taming parlour, steak and cheese, tradie, loves smoking and farting, veggie patty, climate change protester and hates JK Rowling, like fucking hates her, ham sub, normal person who forgot their lunch, veggie sub, vegan who forgot their lunch, pizza sub, you're either hungover or a young teen who forgot their lunch, meatball sub, you're the big man, you're Daryl Broman, seafood sub, you're fucked in the head, and tuna sub, you're fucked in the head, but not as fucked in the head as these people. The teriyaki sub, though, is the sub for everyone, the people's sub and my gateway sub that got me into other subs. Anyway, let's give it a go. Fair bit of shit on them. They taste like sweet chicken chips, so normal chicken chips, but with a real sweet aftertaste. They're fucking boring. 5 out of 10.
