Righto, the Milo Milky Bar. Very fucking keen on this. I feel like it's gonna taste like the most nostalgic combo of all time. Milo brand ice cream and Milo. If you didn't eat this growing up, your parents were fucking shit. A quick shout out to the brown tin Milo. This was always my favourite too. Let's get into it. It's crisp malt balls and Milo powder. It is fucking packed and has the most Milo-est smell ever. Okay, it's pretty fucking good but it's not a 10 out of 10 like I thought it'd be. It has the texture of this block, then it's classic Milky Bar with Milo cereal and Milo mixed through it. Bit too much cereal, there should be more Milo in my opinion. Will it rival last year's treat of the year? No, it's an 8.5 out of 10. It's fucking good but it's not what I thought it would be and it's nothing like the ice cream combo I showed earlier.
