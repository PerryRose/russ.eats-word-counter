Righto, the new Brookvale Union Vodka Passion Fruit. Now this brand really caught my attention with this. Usually I don't like low sugar shit, but I didn't even fucking notice. And 6%, this ruined my housewarming, but it is a dangerous drop of piss and tasty as fuck. I've also just noticed this is 4% and it's full sugar, so it's actually nothing like that one I just showed you. Sorry to disappoint ya. Anyways, I'm a little bitch for a passion fruit drink. Apparently it's uniquely Australian that we love passion fruit flavored drinks so much compared to everywhere else in the world. These two are absolutely gorgeous. And then you add a little bit of orange in with that passion fruit and it's even fucking more naughty. This is my favorite juice on the market and these deep springs are fucking refreshing as. So if it's not obvious, I'm passionate about me passion fruit. Let's do it. That is fucking delicious. It's like these two drinks mixed together. It's an 8 out of 10, but if they can nail the low sugar taste like they did with the lemon squash and bring it out in 6%, it'll be the single best drop of piss on the market besides my Wilson's flavor. An absolute fucking treat. Also, if you made it this far in the video, you're a true fan. There's a few leftover Russ Eats hats and Russ Fests shirts. Link in the bio. There's fuck all left, so if you want them, grab them. If not, then goodnight and have a good one.
