Righto, we're back with another low-key treat of the month. If you missed the first one, this is where I try treats that fall outside of the scope of the normal shit that I review. For October, with only one day left, we are doing Aldi chocolate. Now, I get asked to do Aldi shit all the time, not just the chocolate, but I avoid this place because it is so fucking cold. It is the coldest place on Earth, I don't know why. The only thing that comes close is a bare bum on a winter toilet seat. They're my top two coldest things. I kick it off with the peanut and caramel. Also, only $3.50, which is pretty good. That's the center of it. This is top-tier shit. That's at least a 9 out of 10. It tastes very similar to this, but I reckon a little bit better. Next, we've got the salted pretzel. By the way, each row is one piece. It just seems odd. That is fucking awesome. Heaps of crunchy salted pretzels, but it's the chocolate on both of these in general that is good. That's an 8.5, but I will be trying a couple of the others. They are cheeky, fucking naughty little things.
