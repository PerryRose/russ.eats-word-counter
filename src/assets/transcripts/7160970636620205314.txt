Righto, some breaking news, another one of the OG treats has been snatched from us. That's right, the Sesame Bar is joining the Jupiter Bar in the Junk Food Graveyard. That is two of the big Europe 4, in my opinion, the two best that are gone. We still have the Honey Nougat Log and the Summer Roll, they're still a treat, they're still an OG, but to me, these were better. You might not have actually tried these because, to be honest, it looks like a fucking Vita Wheat or something your budgie would eat, but I can assure you it was a fucking treat. It was unique, chewy caramel with toasted sesame, nothing else like it in my opinion, it will be missed. Here's the proof, by the way, straight from the source, Cadbury Australia, who owns it, it's Europe Sesame Bar, deleted, can't find it anywhere, hi, thanks for getting in touch, we're sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but the Europe Sesame Bar is fucking gone.
