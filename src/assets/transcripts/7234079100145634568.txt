Righto, the new Maltesers, Black Forest GÃ¢teau and Tiramisu, the desserts range. Now firstly, the word desserts reminds me of a quick story. Now, I scrolled through Facebook the other day and I have heaps of people on there that I do not even really know or talk to. And this was someone from school's mum posted this meme with the caption something dumb like, No wonder I eat ice cream when I'm stressed. Stressed is dessert, spelled backwards. And I was just thinking, shut the fuck up. And it infuriated me because the comments were filled with mums that just found it absolutely hilarious. And anyway, the point of this story is it just pissed me off and I don't know why and I deleted them. Now, I'm a big believer in letting the mums play, but that was a shit meme and I won't be having that. Anyway, let's get into it. Black Forest smells absolutely fucking gorgeous. Yeah, they are fucking delicate and naughty. Just like the Black Forest Tim Tam except not as rich and it's like a real cherry flavor, not that really fake medicine cherry. They are awesome. The dark chocolate worked so well. Nine out of ten. Tiramisu. Now, it smells like instant coffee. I'm a bit of a coffee snob. So a little bit of a turn off up front, but let's see how they taste. They're okay. It's just like coffee chocolate, but all coffee flavored stuff tastes like international roast to me. So if you like instant coffee, you'll love these. But if you're a bit of a coffee snob like me, you'll think they're below average.
