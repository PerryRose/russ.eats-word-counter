Righto, Sour Patch Space Kids. Now, I wasn't going to review this bag because I just thought they were normal Sour Patch Kids shaped as little astronauts, which is fucking boring. And it pisses me off, by the way, haven't they learnt to stop telling kids that they're going to grow up to be a fucking astronaut or something phenomenal? Because I don't know a single astronaut. Everyone I know has fucking boring jobs. And now we all just feel a bit sad and disappointed that we didn't become something better with our lives because they fucking kept telling you at school that you had to be a fucking astronaut. Anyways, Peach and Cream. That's why I'm reviewing this bag. Something different for once, not just another fucking fruit flavoured Sour Patch Kid. Peach and Cream are one of the OG lollies. I don't even know who fucking made them. You just always got them in a little sappy bag for 50 cents from a canteen. Let's kick it off with the headliner, Peaches and Cream. Okay, that is literally a Peaches and Cream lolly with fucking sour shit around it. That is amazing. And it's different. Different than normal Sour Patch Kids. I wish this was the full bag. I'm giving that an 8.5 out of 10. Let's do the others. Strawberry Black Currant. That's yum, but the Black Currant just overpowers it. 6 out of 10. Watermelon Lime. Lime overpowers that. 5 out of 10. And Pineapple Orange. That's yum and accurate, but just a bit boring. 6.5 out of 10. So overall, the bag is pretty fucking boring and the Peaches and Cream, even though it's a standout, doesn't really fit in with the other flavours if that makes sense. I'm going to give this bag overall a 5 out of 10, but the Peaches and Cream is a must try. Fingers crossed they bring out a full bag of these fuckers because they're awesome.
