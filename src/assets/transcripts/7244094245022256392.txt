Right, the Curtis Stone Raspberry and Hazelnut Tart. Now this is the second Curtis Stone block and last time it divided everyone in the comments. It's the first time I've done a re-review and the first time I was called a cunt. I figured out that there was some blocks that had little biscuit bits that absorbed the caramel and made it like stale tasting. So when I did the re-review, got a couple of chewy bits of biscuit which were pretty shit and I dropped it to a six and a half. Let's do an unboxing. So it's raspberry flavoured sauce, chopped cream and hazelnut pieces. Didn't really have much stink when I opened it up but it looks fucking mad in the middle. Let's do it. Also when I think tarts, I think of the bakery. Fuck this fancy shit off. We want a custard or a neenish tart block or even a lemon meringue. Imagine like a fucking white chocolate outside with meringue and lemon filling. Oh, oh, anyway. Nah, it tastes like it belongs in a box of roses which isn't a fucking good thing. It's a real jam like, like a rich raspberry. The hazelnuts do balance it out but it's not working for me. I don't know. It's fucking hard to explain. I'm giving that a five out of ten.
