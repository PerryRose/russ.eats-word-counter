Righto, Neapolitan Oreos. Now, I don't do Oreos too often, but every time I buy them, I forget how fucking much I actually like them. And they're cheap as fuck. $1.75 for a full tube. In my opinion, they're a top-tier picky. Anyway, I couldn't say no. Neapolitan flavor. Everything Neapolitan flavor I've tried has been fucking awesome. The standout though of Neapolitan products was this. If you didn't get to try this, I fucking feel sorry for you. This was incredible. Second best, the Oak Neapolitan Thickshake. Anyways, let's get into it. They smell fucking awesome, and they're half strawberry, half vanilla, and a chocolate biscuit. That's how you get the Neapolitan profile. I'll show you the middle. There you go. Focus. Let's do it. Okay, so these just taste like dilute strawberry Oreos, if that makes sense. Now, I fucking love strawberry Oreos, so I'm not gonna let bias take over. This is supposed to be Neapolitan flavor. It's not. It's strawberry flavor. So for that, it's a 5 out of 10. If you like strawberry Oreos, buy strawberry Oreos. Don't waste your fucking time on these.
