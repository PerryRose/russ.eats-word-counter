Righto, I've finally got my hands on the Prime flavours. Let's do it. Now you're probably wondering what the fuck is Prime. It's a low sugar, low calorie sports drink just like Powerade Zero or No Sugar Gatorade. It's owned by PSY and a bloke named Paul. And their mascot's this weird motherfucker that loves tucking kids into bed. Now I can't remember a product having this much hype in my lifetime. It's fucking ridiculous. People are paying like $50 a bottle. There is a black market at schools and it's the official sports drink of the UFC. Here's me in my debut. But does it live up to the hype? Let's find out. Tropical Punch. We're off to a bad start. That one's fucking pissed. 3 out of 10. It tastes like medicine and is overly sweet with a filthy fake sugar aftertaste. Lemon Lime. Way better but still super sweet like fucking strong ass cordial. I'm going to give that one a 6.5 out of 10. Nice fresh lemon lime taste. Do the job on a hangover. Orange. That one's even better. 7.5 out of 10. Just like an orange Gatorade. Not much of that aftertaste either. Not bad. Ice Pop. That also tastes like medicine. An overly sweet cherry flavour. 4 out of 10. Metamoon. This is some sci-fi looking shit. Okay, this one's interesting because it's different. It tastes like a lolly shop smells. That's the only way I can describe this. This one's probably the best. 8 out of 10. Just because it's different. Overall, super disappointing. Gatorade no sugar shits on these. They don't have that classic sports drink taste. Orange is probably the only one that does. They just taste like really strongly mixed cordial.
