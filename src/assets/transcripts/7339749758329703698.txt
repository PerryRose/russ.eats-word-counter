Righto, the February low-key treat of the month is this bastard behind me. I know what you're thinking, it's not very low-key, but so many people have asked me to try it, and it's been out for about a year, and I don't usually do tub ice cream, so I thought it's going to fit into this series. Also, I've got to flex these sleeve sponsors. The official sleeve sponsor of the Hammersmith Hills Hoist. They're an Aussie league team over in fucking London. How good is that? I had to flex that. Now, I've been through hell for this review. My local Coles has the shittest freezer. There's fucking icebergs over every single ice cream. Even though there's record profits in Coles, they can't even fix the fucking freezer. Anyway, I got this jam donut ice cream. It's looking a bit frosty, but it was caked with ice. And what happened was it melted in the paper bags. Those shit fucking bags. Sogged out the bottom, then it fell apart in the car park. I was calling everyone cunts. I was thinking it loudly. And then, yeah, anyway, so I've been through a bit for this, so it better be good. There it is. Looks pretty fucking good. It is donut and sweet cream flavoured ice cream, raspberry syrup, and donut cookies. Let's go. Okay, it's fucking spot on. The raspberry jam and the squash cinnamon donut throughout it works so well. I know people whinge that this is expensive, but this ice cream in here tastes like the kind of ice cream you'd pay fucking nine bucks a cup for at a gelato place. I'm giving that a nine out of ten. That is absolutely naughty.
