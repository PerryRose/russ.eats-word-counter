Right-o, the new Twisted Raspberry Twisties. I apologise about my voice, I sound like fucking Kurt Cobain. I've got influenza B. The only thing I'm grateful for is that I still have my taste buds. But I've had to pull out of Alt-J on Wednesday, and I don't think I'm gonna make it to the Smashing Pumpkins tomorrow. So I'm a little bit depressed to say the least. Let's see if these can restore some happiness. First of all, the packaging is a complete ripoff to the Fabulousious range. And I want to mention that it isn't the first time that Twisties haven't done a savoury flavour. They did this sweet butter toffee flavour back in the day. I never tried them, I heard they're amazing. And they did sour Twisties. I did try these, they tasted like fucking reflux, they were horrible. Let's get straight into it. I do not know about these, eh. It's fucking weird. It starts off really sour, but then towards the end it tastes exactly like raspberry jam on toast or corn thins. Mainly corn thins. So if you've had this, you've tried this before. I don't know. I don't want to keep eating them, so I'm only giving them a 5 out of 10. But they're okay.
