Righto, the Jumfru Graveyard Part 13, we're doing piss. Now a lot of these you can still buy, but they're dead to me, that's why they're in this series. I'm kicking it off with the OG Goon, Fruity Lexia to be specific, but usually I got the Golden Oak. Now, this is the OG for me, it was the first thing I ever got pissed on, a Wet'n'Wild cup full of Goon and Green Cordial. Fucking Coddy's cooler. Now I know you can obviously still get Goon, but if you're still drinking it, get fucking help. I've gotta mention Rich Goon, the Cranberry Smirnoff sacks when these come out. I remember going to a party with private school kids, and they were playing Goon of Fortune with this, and I was like, fuck me, these cunts have money. Then we've got Pulse, mainly this flavour, I can still taste it. This was a fucking alcoholic energy drink, it doesn't get any better. They absolutely rattled you at 7% as well. Then we've got the Poor Man's Pulse Elevate. These had a really distinct fermented taste that was fucked. They were brutal, 8%, cheap as fuck, and these nearly killed people. I know so many people that have stories of like the worst heart palpitations they've ever had. My brother's mate James, he was not good, he had 8 of them at New Year's. I was like fucking 15, I remember him coming home just fucking fucked. Speaking of drinks that nearly killed people, the Toohey's Extra Dry Platinum. Now beers are strong these days because of all the craft beers, but this was like the first one I remember that was strong as fuck, 6.5%, and they came in an 8-pack, which I just don't know why the strongest beer came in an 8-pack, but these flogged ya. I'm not even halfway, we're gonna have to do a part 2, maybe 3.
