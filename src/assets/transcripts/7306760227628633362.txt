Righto, the Macca's Summer Launch. I won't be doing the Onion Rings, I did them at KFC the other month and I couldn't stop farting, Demi nearly left me, it's a whole story, and the Chicken Big Mac just bores me. But, we're doing the return of the McRib, the Tim Tam McFlurry, and the Deluxe McRib. I forgot to mention, if the Deluxe McRib goes well, they're gonna bring out the Marilyn Manson McRib, which is exactly the same, except they remove the two bottom ribs. Quick look, you got Bickies and a Tim Tam sauce in that one, the OG McRib, and the Deluxe has mayo, lettuce, and tomato added to it. Kicking it off with the OG McRib. Yeah, fuck, that's exactly like I remember, the onion pickles and that fucking sauce is amazing, I do love them, okay, I'm giving them a 9 out of 10. I know I usually hate on Macca's, but they're good, okay. And the Deluxe, very saucy on this side. 5 out of 10, all the extra shit just makes that taste like a Grand Angus, that is just, nah. And the Tim Tam McFlurry. 6 out of 10, nothing like a Tim Tam, and the chocolate sauce is like a fake home brand chocolate sauce, I'd way rather the hot fudge, that's pretty disappointing. Quick deleted scene, I just caught Ollie having a lick of the Tim Tam McFlurry, at least someone likes it, I'm not gonna finish it so he can fucking have it.
