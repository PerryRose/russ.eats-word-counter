Righto, Red Bull's back with another weird flavour, Fig and Apple. Now to me energy drinks should have crazy names like Green Storm, Orange Surge, Purple Haze, Pineapple Express, Blue Batman, Black Widow, Brown Heart. That's what an energy drink, I think they're all energy drinks, should sound like. But Red Bull's trying to be different, they're trying to stand out, but let's see if it's any good. Let's do it, the Jade Edition. It's alright, it's quite fresh for an energy drink, like not a fake flavour, it's like a real apple flavour, like Cloudy Apple Juice, Granny Smith. Not getting much Fig, it's alright, but I probably won't buy it again, I'm gonna give that a 6.5 out of 10.
