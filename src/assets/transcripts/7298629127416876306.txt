Righto, Brookvale Union's back with another low sugar 6% up, this time we have orange. Now when I reviewed Hard Solo, I said I want to see a hard Fanta, a hard Coke, all that shit. And you know what? This is close enough. Now when Brookvale Union brought this out, I thought they were going to take over the whole 6% low sugar market. But then they followed it up with this absolute can of fucking chalk. If you tried this, let me know in the comments if you agree, it was pretty fucking shit. But, let's see if they can restore some faith with vodka orange. You can't really go wrong with orange, unless you're talking hair colour. Let's do it. I was kidding about the red hair joke. I am technically a redhead, okay? I get it all through my beard and a couple of pubes too. Okay, that is pretty dangerous. Considering it's low sugar and 6%, it's pretty fucking good. But you definitely taste the vodka, like my mouth is warm. I don't know how many I could get through before I'd fucking feel a bit sick from that. And you do get the low sugar taste, but not as bad, not as chalky as that fucking tropical punch. I'll give that a 7 though, okay? I will be fucking dusting a couple of these off around the pool over the Chrissy break. That is for sure.
