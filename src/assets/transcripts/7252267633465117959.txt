Righto, the new Macca's Winter Launch, the Spicy Sticky BBQ Angus, Mozzarella Sticks, the Raspberry Custard Pie, and McFlurry. Order number DD, like Tommy's Mums and Rugrats, 36. Now I was gonna kick it off with the Sticky Spicy Angus, but they've forgotten the fucking sauce, seriously. Third time in a row, missing the sauce. I'm going back, I'm fucking going back. I came through about 20 minutes ago, and I got the new Spicy Sticky Angus. And they forgot the sauce, so it's not sticky or spicy. Yeah. What sauce was it then? Well it was the Spicy Sticky Sauce, it's just got mayo on the one I've got. Told you I'd go back. Here it is against the photo. A bit fucking messy, but they always are. And at least this one has sauce. 6 out of 10. It's one of the better Angus launches, but the sauce is literally just a BBQ sauce with a little bit of spice. So pretty underwhelming, not very sticky. We'll do the Mozzarella Sticks with the sauce. 6 out of 10. The dipping sauce is like a chilli jam, pretty fucking good. But they're no better than air fried mozzarella sticks in my opinion. The Raspberry Custard Pie looks pretty similar to the picture. 8.5 out of 10. That's fucking awesome. The custard with the raspberry works so well. That is naughty and the McFlurry, it's got a raspberry sauce and a smashed up pie through it. 6.5 out of 10. It's literally just the pie smashed through ice cream. You could do it with your own ice cream for a lot cheaper at home. But the raspberry sauce is a bit of a treat.
