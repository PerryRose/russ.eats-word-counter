Righto, it's been a while between Billy's Pineberry Splash. Now, a pineberry is actually a fruit. See, I found this out five minutes ago when I googled pineberry. If anyone knows where to get weird, rare fruits like this, please let me know. I would love to review shit like this, because I need to review some healthy shit. I'm up 11 kilos since starting Russ Eats. Seriously, go through my videos. You can see me shrink as you get further and further into the past. Anyways, let's get straight into it. Okay, I think I know what this is supposed to be. The colours fucking give it away. Plus, Lemon Splash tastes like a lemonade popsicle, so I'm assuming this is another fucking popsicle-style flavour. The only thing that's different compared to this, though, is it isn't as tangy. I feel like it needs a little bit more of that fucking Clipo twang to really capture this flavour. It is fucking nice, though, but I'm going to give it a 7.5. A bit more twang, and that would be, like... It would be above Twister, in my opinion.
