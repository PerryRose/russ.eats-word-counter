Righto, I thought this was a piss tank. Coriander Doritos, they're fucking real. They showed up at my door this morning. Now, I don't believe they're gonna come to shops. My pack says $2.91 at $500. Only 500 packs in Australia. So you're just gonna have to take my word for it on how they taste. Now, we all know the argument. Coriander tastes like soap. Apparently 10% of people, it tastes like soap to them. Now, I'm one of the few people that actually loves the taste of soap, especially Imperial Leather. This is the tastiest. But these, the only problem with Imperial Leather is they're a fucking pube magnet. Have you ever seen an Imperial Leather without a pube lodged into the back of it? No, you haven't. Anyways, enough about pubes. Let's fucking try it. There they are. Okay, super intense coriander flavor, but it's only up front. The only thing that was similar were these behind me, if you had them before. And as you keep chewing, they just taste like Cool Ranch, which is okay with me. I fucking love these. So if you like coriander and Cool Ranch, I think you'll quite like them. I'm gonna give them a 7 out of 10. Not too bad at all. I'm a little bit surprised, but I also like coriander and soap, so I'm not really the person to ask.
