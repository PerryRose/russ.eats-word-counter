Righto, the fourth cruiser double to come out, but this one's a bit different. Low sugar, 8.6 grams of sugar, where the other ones are full sugar. Now, I didn't mind the other ones, but I need to warn you. They are the new double blacks, so be fucking careful. I wish I got to warn this fella. Val, I'm sorry I didn't warn you. They're obviously fucking pretty brutal, so be responsible. He was on the Guava Doubles, and look what he fucking uploaded to his story. So they're obviously very, very dangerous. Five and a half out of ten. It's got some room for improvement. So firstly, it's super fucking sweet. It's missing that posido tang that I really wanted in a passion fruit drink, and I can really feel the vodka on the throat. Bonus points, because you don't get any of that shit low sugar aftertaste. That's a bonus point, but honestly, I'm a little bit disappointed.
