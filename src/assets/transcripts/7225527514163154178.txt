Righto, Chupa Chup milk, strawberries and cream and choco vanilla. A lot of people think this is weird I reckon this is one of the few collabs that'll work. This will work if they're based off these two flavours, the cream flavoured Chupa Chups But I've said it before, the only Chupa Chups I've seen in the last three years were at Bucks parties And they all ended up creamy anyway, nah. I'm sorry, even I'm disappointing myself after that one But back to the review. This milk is made by Breka or Breka, which I haven't seen since primary school, top left. Now, this is owned by the same company that owns Oak The only difference between the range is they use full cream milk, this range uses reduced fat milk Which is shit, and then same with this milk But is Breka still big in other states? Because Oak's big in New South Wales, Big M's massive in Victoria Brown's Chili's massive in Western Australia. Are any other states still drinking Breka? Because I haven't seen it in fucking ages Kicking it off with strawberries and cream, it smells absolutely spot-on Yeah, that's fucking mad. Exactly like the strawberries and cream lollipop, very similar to a normal strawberry milk But there's something a little bit magic about this. I fucking, I rate it eight and a half out of ten Now the Choco Vanilla Yeah, that's spot-on to the lollipop as well. That one's not as good, but it's still very fucking close I'm enjoying both of them. Seven and a half out of ten, not a bad release
