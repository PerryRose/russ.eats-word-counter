Righto, Caramilk Crunchy Bites. This is one of those reviews where, yeah, the food matters, but I really just want to tell you it's a fucking story. So last night, I went to the Culture Club in Maitland, which is fucking awesome, by the way. This burger was sick, but that's not the story. Now, there was a band playing. Now, instead of a van, this band had all of their equipment in the back of a hearse where the coffin goes, which was pretty fucking weird, but that's not also the- that's not the story, okay? Now, years ago, my mum had a friend, and this is fucked up. She had a friend who used to drive a hearse, and instead of an esky, had a coffin, a child's coffin, at that, that he put the beers in. Now, if that's not some sort of fucked up, twisted person, I- I don't- I didn't know them, so if you're watching this right now, I'm sorry if you're normal, but I'm gonna assume you're not. Anyways, Caramilk Crunchy, I feel like this is gonna be very sweet. I'm also kind of over Caramilk, but it's been long enough between releases that I did get slightly excited over this. Let's do it. Here's the pieces. Decent size, nice Caramilk smell, as usual. Okay, they're fucking yum, but they are literally a renamed Hokey Pokey. I'm not gonna say they're a scam, but I am gonna say it's a tactical rename that Crunchy maybe has a better brand- brand power? I don't fucking know in Australia. I don't really care, either. I gave that a 9.5 out of 10, but because of price and shit, I'm gonna give these ones an 8.5. Very, very sweet, too.
