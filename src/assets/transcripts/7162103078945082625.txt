Righto, as you know on a Friday occasionally I like to drink just a little bit of piss But this one's something special this review is dedicated to the one of the most incredible fucking things I've ever seen in my life So last night I went to see idols at the end more and someone took off their full Prosthetic leg when they were yelling shooey and then they all started chanting leggy and the fucking drummer Drank a full Guinness out of someone's prosthetic leg. It's probably the most phenomenal thing I've ever seen in my fucking life. So this goes out to you Anyways, we've got the new double grape Suntory 196 we've all had the lemon ones they're fucking dangerous and I just have so much respect for this brand because they're fucking turned the Whole bottle on its head everyone's doing this shit now just like when white claw come out and now there's fucking seltzers everywhere But I think seltzers are a bit shit where these are a fucking treat. Anyway, let's go It's pretty good, it's dangerous. It's like that Gatorade fake grape flavor, which is weird because it's showing the green grapes on the front Which I associate that with fresh grapes and like the purple with fake great But there's like the 6% alcohol and the fake sugar kind of having an argument in the in the back taste pretty good I could easily smash it because I'm like fuck we used to drink goon. So this is just well above anything I've ever had in my life. I've never had anything like this. I've never had anything like this I could easily smash it because I'm like fuck we used to drink goon. So this is just well above anything I've drank in my past. I'm gonna give this a 7 1‚ÅÑ2 out of 10. It's good. It's dangerous and be responsible Don't drink it out of a bit of a prosthetic leg
