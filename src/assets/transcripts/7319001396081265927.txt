Righto, it's been a while since we've done a Russ Eats Creations, we are doing the Flame Grilled Double Quarter Pounder. Now, I love a double quarter pounder, one of the only Macca's items that I fucking absolutely froth, but since doing the Kilogrammer, I can't even smell their meat patties without my fucking butthole actually quivering in fear. Personally, I think the Hungry Jack's patties are better, but the rest of the Double QP I fucking love. So it's simple, we're just switching the patties over to create what I think is the ultimate fast food hangover burger. And it's New Year's Day, we fucking need it today, this is the first thing I'm putting into my guts and it's fucking 4.30. Also, I did the McZinger combo, if you missed this, I've pinned it to the top of my profile. Now here's the build process, I'm mainly showing you this just to prove that it is possible to get the cheese in the centre of the fucking burger. Have a look at that, I had to add some more sauce too, there is never enough. Okay, let's dig in, also look how big the patties are, they are fucking huge compared to the Macca's ones. Holy fuck, that is better than I expected, a normal Double QP when hungover is like an 8.5 out of 10, this brings it up to a 9.5. But it got a little bit cold, that would have brought it to the 10, having to drive between the fucking restaurants, probably not worth the fuck around, but a little bit of fun.
