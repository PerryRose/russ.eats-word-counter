Righto, another Suntory-inspired product has hit the market, this one is Barry. 5.6% though, not 6%, 1.5% standard drinks, low sugar, blah blah blah. Now I'm not sure of the full story behind the drink, it is very similar in appearance to the Grog by Cold Ones drink though, like nearly identical, and it's shoku and vodka as well. And I think it's owned by Bailey Smith from the AFL, and Reece Walsh from NOL has something to do with it. They are way too good looking for footy players. Back in my day, footy players were the ugliest cunts you'd ever see, with names like Grubb, Slug, Beaver, absolute fucked names. This, this, footy's come a long way. Now it is a Friday, and before I hit the piss, I've been smashing these. I honestly think they work, I thought they were like the power bands right, like a placebo effect, but I've had them a fair few times now, and I've woken up way better than I usually do. Here's some proof, I was absolutely fucked at mum's wedding, even did a cover of Killing In The Name Of, and this, along with James and Justin, had the bay juice, and we woke up fine. It did not save Uncle Tony though. Nothing was, nothing was gonna save Uncle Tony that night. Speaking of mum's wedding, don't be rude and say fucking congrats in the comments, alright? I'm sorry, I'm nearly out of time, I've just talked shit for most of the review. The watermelon and lemon, that is fucking dog shit. Two out of ten, you cannot taste any watermelon and no tang from the lemon. It almost tastes like it has an Elevate aftertaste. No. And the crushed lemon. Stick to footy boys. Sorry, I love yous, but they're pretty fucking shit. I'm gonna give that one a five and a half out of ten, it's better. They're more like a seltzer, I was expecting them to be like a suntory, but they're missing the tang and the sweetness.
