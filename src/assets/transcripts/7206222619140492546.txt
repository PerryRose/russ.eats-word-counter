Righto, Chupa Chup Cola and Strawberries and Cream Glazed Popcorn. Now I said this last time, but I forgot that Chupa Chups existed until I went to my first Bucks party, and I don't remember them being salty, but it wa- nah, I'm kidding, I didn't do it, I swear, I'm not that fuckin' filled, I didn't do it. Anyway, Chupa Chups have come back in all sorts of forms. Sour Bites, these chews, which are incredible, like the name says, Ice Blocks Custard, Soft Drinks Overseas, and even Ice Creams, they're back in all sorts of forms. Now I wasn't even gonna bother with this popcorn until I seen that it was made by Green's. And Green's makes the Lolli Gobble Bliss Bombs, which I fuckin' love, so I'm gonna imagine that these are the same as this, but with cola and strawberries and cream flavoring, which I'm fuckin' all for. Let's get into it. Starting with cola, looks exactly like the Lolli Gobble, but darker. Okay, that's better than I thought it would be, it is literally like the Lolli Gobble Bliss Bomb popcorn, but with the Chupa Chup cola around the outside. I don't know if it works, it's a bit fuckin' sus, I'm gonna give that one a 6.5 out of 10. They didn't lie, it is what it says it is. Now the strawberries and cream, these are pink as fuck and they smell so sweet. Okay, that works better, but it is so fuckin' sweet, but I don't mind it, I'm giving them a 7.5 out of 10. They didn't lie, and it's more like a candy and they're so fucked for your teeth, it's like toffee and corn fuckin' all through your teeth. I'm actually kind of impressed, they're not bad and they're accurate.
