Righto, two new Bilsons, the Mystery Flavor and Black Current. Funny story about this. Now after the Twister launch party, I actually got to try this before it's been released, so I've already tried the Black Current Bilsons, but I actually walked out with it and I left it somewhere. I didn't litter, I know I didn't put it there, but someone's obviously found it and then they've taken this photo and it's ruined the whole launch and I woke up the next morning thinking, I think that was me, so I think this was me, I'm sorry. Let's do it. So, that's better than I remember. It is exactly the same as this. They've somehow captured the lolly flavor too, like you want to chew it. That's fucking incredible. If you like these, you're going to think that's the best thing ever. I'm going to give that one an 8 out of 10. And the Mystery Flavor, now I actually have no idea what this is. I actually asked Bilsons to not let me know what new shit is because I actually get excited when I see it come out. When you know everything that's coming out, it's not as fun. So this, I had no idea about. Okay, that just tastes like the Blue Hawaiian, but without the creamy taste. Blue Hawaiian was vanilla raspberry, so I reckon this is just raspberry. Maybe red licorice, red rippers, red skins, red frogs, fucking something like that. That's my guess. It's pretty good, refreshing, pretty sweet. Going to give it a 7 though.
