Righto, Fairy Floss Zoopa Doopa Milk. I don't know about this. Last year they did this and it was sus. Quick recap of the last release. I said it was all a publicity stunt to get people talking about Zoopa Doopas just before summer to buy the ice blocks. That's what I thought. This was my reviews. Tasted like bubble bath. Tasted like a sus strawberry. Tasted like the Allen's Pineapple Milk. So it just looks like strawberry milk. Let's go. It's actually not as shit as I thought it would be. It kind of works. If you really like that fake Fairy Floss flavour, I think you'll like it. I'm going to give it a 6 out of 10. It's really sweet, but it is what it says it is so I can't really complain. Let's see if Ollie likes this one. Wakey wakey. He's going for it. Oh. One couple of points.
