Right-o, Green Apple Gatorade. About fucking time we got a new flavour. In America, they get one like every second week. In Australia, we've had Pineapple, Strawberry and Arctic Blitz and that's eaten about eight years and it pisses me off. Now, Gatorade's always been my number one but on the Outback QB NFL podcast, they did a bit of a vote for the best sports drink and I couldn't believe how many people said Gold Rush Wallaby. I'm gonna have to fucking run it to a vote. In my opinion, the only thing Powerade has over Gatorade is the lid. And speaking of NFL and Gatorade, you can actually bet on the fucking colour of the Gatorade at the end of the match and Purple won it 11 bucks. So if you got on that, good on ya. Anyways, let's do it. That is a fucking liquid lolly. That is confectionary. It tastes like the Green Apple Starburst Fruitful. That could fix even the most hungover of all people. Slight tang aftertaste. I fucking love it. Eight and a half out of ten.
