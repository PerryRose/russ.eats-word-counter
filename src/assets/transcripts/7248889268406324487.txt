Righto, once again there's been some absolute legends dropping some food goss. Hungry Jax is bringing out a Biscoff Storm and a Biscoff Shake. This is fucking huge. The main reason this is so big is that this leaked a while ago, the Biscoff McFlurry, and everyone was going crazy about it. This was a UK photo. They launched this over there. It was never coming to Australia. The rumoured launch date is the 11th of July, along with these two making a comeback. And off topic, but cheers to the June rats for giving me a shout out at the Cane Bay last night. I was getting a drink. Otherwise I would have jumped the fucking barrier and got up and unleashed on stage.
