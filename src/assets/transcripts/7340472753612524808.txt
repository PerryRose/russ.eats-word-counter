Righto, why didn't no one tell me that they sell these fucking Starbursts at Kmart, okay? Seriously, have a look at this. They're eight bucks. That's probably the only negative. And they're the imported version, so I'm about to check if they taste the same. But I nearly had to check my undies mid-shopping trip. I went in to get the crispy marshmallows, seen Starbursts, and thought, am I in an ultimate reality? Has something happened? One negative is it isn't the original. Remember when they changed cherry to blackcurrant and lemon to lemon-lime? This is the same as that pack. Anyways, let's try them. The strawberry's in a red packet, not pink, which is weird. Orange, blackcurrant, lemon-lime. Yep, strawberry and orange, exactly the same as the OGs, and the blackcurrant and lemon-lime are a fucking absolute treat. What a little hidden gem. This has made my week.
