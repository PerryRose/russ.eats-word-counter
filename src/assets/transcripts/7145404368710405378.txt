By the way, I'm gonna rate these out of 10 and the tang-o-meter Let's see how much tang these have. Starting with green apple That's delicious, that's fucking eight and a half out of ten. It's a granny smith apple in a drink It has granny smith tang. So that's about a seven and a half out of ten on the tang-o-meter Black cherry That is a cherry starburst chew in a fucking drink That is an eight and a half out of ten, especially if you love cherry and about the same tang Watermelon, let's go That one was disappointing, six and a six. Lemon, now this should have some fucking tang I think I'm getting tolerant to the tang But that's only about a five in flavor and probably a six and a half in tang. Blue raspberry, let's go I think I'm tolerant to the tang. That's got no tang. Quick apple sip to check if I'm tolerant to the tang No, I'm not Seven in flavor, five in tang. So here's me tang faces, by the way. Some of the best fizzy drinks I've had in ages. Eight out of ten overall for the range It could be more sour, but it probably would give me reflux then
