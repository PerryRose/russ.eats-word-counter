Righto, my first vegan comparison video, the plant-based Golden Gay Time. I'm going to do a blind taste test first, and then I'm going to do a review. Ingredients-wise, they're both as unhealthy as each other. The main difference is obviously the plant-based one's made with pea protein and water, whereas the normal one is made with the milk for innocent, innocent mummy cow. Okay, here comes the blind taste test. So green wrapper is the plant-based, and brown wrapper is the normal one. Pass me that. Get it in there, you can't hear it. Get the next one ready. I reckon that's normal for sure. Yeah, it's plant-based. It's like fucking ice. Was I right? Yeah, you're right. Yeah, that tastes like shit. It's okay. Okay, so I was a bit harsh in the blind test because that tastes so creamy compared to that, but if I didn't bite that first, I think I wouldn't have noticed as much. I am enjoying it. It's not that shit. I'm probably going to give that like an 8 out of 10, where that's a 9 out of 10. If you're a vegan, most of your food tastes like fart anyway, so this is probably as good as it gets.
