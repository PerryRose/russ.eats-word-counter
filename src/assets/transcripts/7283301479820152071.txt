Righto, Guzman's jumping on the fried chicken bandwagon, by himself, tenders, and on a taco. But, I've had confirmation you will be able to add them to your burrito very soon. This is making me think, fried chicken on a Guzman burrito is gonna top the twister. KFC keeps fucking us around not bringing the OG's back with the diced tomato. There's something about diced tomato that you need with your fried chicken on a wrap that just fucking makes it. Let's see if this is just as good. Okay, they don't actually look that good. They look pretty processed and a little fucked up. But I don't care about them by themselves. I want to have them on the taco. Here's the hard, there's the flaccid taco, and the Cali burrito. I ordered it without filling, and I've chucked my own on. This is what I'm most keen for. Let's fucking do it. Kicking off with the tender by itself. Also, they gave me chipotle mayo, not spicy chipotle. Not happy. 6 out of 10. Nowhere near as good as KFC, but it doesn't taste as shit as the air fried band-aids from Hungry Jack's. Somewhere in the middle, wouldn't bother by himself. Hard one first. And the flaccid. Tacos are underwhelming. They taste like something that you would just make at home. So I'm going to give them a 5 out of 10. And the Cali with tenders. Okay, so the burrito's good. 7 out of 10, but it's nothing like a Twister. And I'm a little bit disappointed, because in my head, I thought this was going to be the best thing in the world. The fried chicken gets a little bit lost amongst all the other shit. It's good, but I wouldn't rush out to get this if you missed the Twister. But if you love Guzman, I think you'll like it.
