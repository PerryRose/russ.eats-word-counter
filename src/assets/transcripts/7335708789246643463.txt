Righto, we've got a new cola cruiser range, Black Cherry Cola and Vanilla Cola. Now you've heard me say before, I'm sick of all the cola piss having bourbon in it. I don't want to taste the bourbon. All I want is a hard Pepsi Max. And this is a step forwards towards that, okay? It is full sugar, but it's a step forwards. Now there is a reason people aren't doing this. And that is, anyone that tries to make a cola drink that doesn't have bourbon masking the shitty taste ends up just tasting like black and gold cola, so let's get straight into it. Starting with the Black Cherry, off to a bad start, that's fucking shit. It's like a melted Zoopa Doopa, super syrupy with like a cherry starburst that's been dropped in it. That's a 3 out of 10, that is dog shit. I hope the vanilla's better. And the vanilla, way fucking better than the Black Cherry. That's an 8 out of 10. That's filling the void that I've been waiting for. It's nothing like a vanilla coke, but it is like this behind me. Slightly syrupy, slightly sugary, but that's expected. They're not going to be exactly the same as Pepsi or Coke. I'm happy, okay? I'm happy with that, but do not bother with the Black Cherry. That's puss.
