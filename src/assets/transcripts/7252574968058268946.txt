Righto, this is an apology video. I've been spreading fake news about the Barista Bros iced coffee for the last few months. Now back in April, I reviewed these canned coffees where I had an anonymous message that said this. Monster has re-released the Java varieties as they're canning Barista Bros, so they're using the Monster brand to hold space in that market. Now I thought he meant that they're canning Barista Bros to compete with Boss iced coffee because everyone's moving towards canned iced coffees, but they meant canned as in getting rid of it. So I've been telling everyone Barista Bros is coming out in cans, and I'm sorry. I'm fucking sorry. Now a lot of people want to hear my comments on this recent axing of Barista Bros. To be honest, I couldn't give a single fuck. I think they're bottom tier iced coffees. If they were good, they wouldn't be getting discontinued. It's as simple as that. The iced chocolate, that wasn't too bad. It was kind of like a chalky custard, but I'm keen to see what they end up replacing the Monster Java cans with. Hopefully it's with something that's actually fucking good.
