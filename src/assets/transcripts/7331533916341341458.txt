Righto, let's see if we've got another Doritos disappointment, the Chaos Cajun Chicken. Honestly, the Doritos launchers have been so weak. This is probably the best thing they've brought out. I still think coriander is the Nickelback of herbs, by the way. Everyone just pretends to hate it, but it's actually pretty fucking good. This is the fourth in the street art collection. There's also a taco flavor, but I couldn't find it and I'm fucking hungry. Anyways, I'll do the honors. Mmm, this smells like normal Doritos. That is weak as piss. There's almost no flavoring on these fuckers. You just get salt, okay? You get kind of like a popcorn chicken taste. No Cajun, no heat. That's fucking dog shit. Especially when you compare it to the flavoring on this fucker. I'm gonna have to give that a 4 out of 10. They are disappointing as fuck, once again.
