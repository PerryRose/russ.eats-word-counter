Righto, it's that time of the year where Doritos repackages Mexicana and calls it something else. The Boss Taco, the fifth of the Street Fart Collection, one of the most disappointing ranges in history. Anyways, let's see if this can taste any different than those behind me. That one's probably the only one that tasted a little bit different to Mexicana. Instant Mexicana, that is fucking comical. Pull your head in, Doritos. That is an absolute piss-take once again. Put some money into R&D for fuck's sake. That is a 1. 1 out of 10 for another scam. Don't waste your money.
