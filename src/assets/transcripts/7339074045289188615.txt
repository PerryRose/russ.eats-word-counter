Righto, another new cruiser, Sour Blue Raspberry. This is the fourth in the Sour range. If you haven't seen any of these, they're only at Liquorland for some fuckin' reason when they're pretty much the only good cruisers. The only negative is they're just never sour enough. I know you're sayin' I always want Tang, but when it says sour in the name, you expect some fuckin' Tang. Also, on Blue Raspberry, do you know where it come from? There wasn't enough shades of red for all the red flavors. Strawberry, cherry, watermelon, and raspberry. So back in the day, they just made Raspberry Blue. That's as simple as that. Let's go. Hey, actually a decent Tang this time. We'll give that a seven and a half out of 10. It's nothing like the Tang of a Brain Licker or the flavor. It's nothing like a Kablooey. It's like the Kablooey Ice Blocks, okay? If you've had them, that's what this tastes like. Not bad.
