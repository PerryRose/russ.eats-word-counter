Righto, Creaming Soda and Hokey Pokey Classic Milk. I don't love these milks, I feel like they're nowhere near as sweet as the others, but these flavours excite me, so let's give it a go. Now, I thought a Creaming Soda milk would taste like shit, but it's gonna taste like a spider, and I keep forgetting that these exist. I have not had one in at least 15 years. The closest I've come to a spider in recent years was the Frozen Coke Float. The Raspberry one of these was revolutionary when I worked at Macca's, but it was a 10% chance if the machine was ever fucking working, and usually you just got stuck with a normal slushie anyway. Let's do it. Okay, that's not Creaming Soda and ice cream like I thought, that is Creaming Soda and milk. That is underwhelming, piss weak, I'm sorry, that's a 3, that is shit. Okay, the Hokey Pokey, is there redemption? Yep, there is redemption, that is a nice, light honeycomb flavour, really easy to drink, 7.5 out of 10, it's kind of made up for that absolute puss.
