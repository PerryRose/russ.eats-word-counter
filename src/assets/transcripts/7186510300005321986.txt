Righto, a follow on to my last junk food graveyard, in this video I mentioned the clear Rugrats icy poles and I was questioning if they were real. Now shit loads of people commented and messaged me saying that they had the exact same memory of eating a clear Rugrats icy pole when they were younger, but they had no proof, there was no photos. Now, I'm excited to announce that I have not one, but two pieces of photographic evidence that these actually existed. The first piece of evidence comes from a bloke named Caleb, who was going through some old family photos over Christmas and come across this. He noticed after some close examination that he was eating a Lil' Lemonade Rugrats ice block. Now this is the only photo of the individual ice block and this matches the exact picture in my memory. Now, Caleb's photo gave me the motivation to keep digging, that I needed more evidence than a fucking grainy photo from 20 years ago. So I was digging through old online catalogues where I found this, the Rugrats magic ice blocks and even went into details about the flavours. These were actually made by Greens, which I didn't know, and they had Lil' Lemonade, Chucky Lime, Phil Cola, Angelica Raspberry and Tommy Orange. There you have it, proof they existed, not another Mandela effect.
