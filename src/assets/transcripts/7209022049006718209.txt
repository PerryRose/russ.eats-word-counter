Righto, my first cereal review, the Teeny Tiny Teddy Honey and Choc Cereal. It just made sense to upload this in the morning, but I don't really eat this kind of cereal anymore. Now that I'm getting old, I really only eat All Brand because it's the only thing that protects the porcelain bowl with all the fucking snacks I'm eating these days. With the exception of these when camping, honestly, this variety pack fucked nearly every one of my family holidays growing up. There was always an argument over who got the Cocoa Pops and someone would end up crying because they got stuck with the fucking Special K or some shit. Starting with Honey, I'm not sure if it's happy or sad, there's no face on it, so they're quite emotionless teddies. Anyway, let's do it. They're pretty shit because I went in with the perspective that they're going to be like a Cocoa Pops sweet, but I think they're trying to be healthy or some shit. These are a 4 out of 10. You can really taste the whole grains, they are quite crunchy and you can taste the honey, but they're fucking bland. Now let's do the Choc. Way better, 7 out of 10 for those ones, they're giving me Milo cereal vibes. Overall, the range is okay if you're not going in with the mindset that they're a full sugary sweet treat cereal. If you just think they're like a normal cereal, you'll probably enjoy them, but don't expect them to be like fucking Crispix and shit like that.
