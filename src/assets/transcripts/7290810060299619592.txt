Righto, ginger beer kettle chips, I've been waiting for this. When I first seen it, I thought this was going to be absolutely fucked. But then I got thinking, chips have gotten pretty weird these days. Here's two perfect examples, what the fuck? These are actual sentences, I can't believe they are flavours. And I've said it before, but that is a ban on Triple J. Here's another example, trio of cheeses. One cheese is enough. Back in my day, we were lucky to get one cheese, let alone three. Let's do it. Ooh. Okay, that's spot on, it's not a ginger chip, it's an actual ginger beer chip. So if you like sweeter chips, and you like ginger beer, I don't think you'll mind it. I want to hate it, it sounds fucked, but I actually don't mind it at all. I thought it was a publicity stunt to get the brand names out there, but I think they're actually on to an okay chip here. So I'm giving it a 7 out of 10, I'm in shock.
