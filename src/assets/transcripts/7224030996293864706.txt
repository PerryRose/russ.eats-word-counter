Righto, the Russ Eats Cocktail School recipe 2, the Peanut Butter Espresso Martini, otherwise known as the Woof-tini. Now I've garnished up front, otherwise the espresso martinis go bubbly if they sit around. I smeared the fuck out of it with peanut butter and chocolate. If you have leftover peanut butter and a dog, don't get any ideas. I only have a cat and his tongue is too rough. Anyway, I crumbed the fuck out of it with peanuts and to be honest, it was a little bit much and a fucking pain in the ass to clean up. Next, this is the key to a good espresso martini. 60ml of hot espresso. It melts the ice and seems to just dilute it and make it a hell of a lot better in my opinion. There are some good cocktail mixers for espresso martinis but I stick to the fresh shit. 2 ice cubes and then sheep dog peanut butter whiskey, 60ml which is 1.63 standard drinks. There's actually only 2 ingredients in this, coffee and peanut butter whiskey. I don't know how I'm going to live there. Shake the absolute fuck out of it until you get it real velvety and have a fucking look at that. That is absolutely gorgeous. A bit over the top but gorgeous. Then 2 pumps of chocolate, couple of beans because I'm a fancy fucker and there you have it. An absolutely gorgeous peanut butter espresso martini. The moment of truth. Have a look at that. Let's get into it. It's just like a normal espresso martini up front but then you get like a whiskey and peanut butter aftertaste. If you don't like strong coffee or whiskey, you will not like this so do not bother. And you don't need to add coffee liqueur. I tried that and it killed all the peanut flavor. This shit, even though it's 35%, is actually pretty fucking sweet which surprised me. Overall, 8 out of 10.
