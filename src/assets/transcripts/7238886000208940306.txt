Righto, the first Tim Tam launch of the year, Coconut Cream Flavour. Every year since 2014, Tim Tam has launched a whole new range in February. Except this year, I noticed and I DM'd them where I got a typical corporate response saying, we're always launching products, keep an eye out, blah, blah, blah. So the new yearly Tim Tam range is dead or on hold at this stage. Also, off topic, but if you run the social media for a massive corporate company, polish up your fucking resume. This'll be the first job that ChatGPT takes, because you're basically a fucking robot already. Also, I'm guessing that they're not launching a range because the Deluxe range was fucking good, so Coles and Woolies must have just said, let's keep this for another year or two. That's my guess. Let's do it, looks amazing, smells amazing. I also should mention, this is a re-launch. It came out under the Zumbo range back in 2015. Yeah, well executed, nice slug of cream, it's like the Bounty flavour. This isn't for everyone, but who it is for are people that like Bounty and Tim Tams. If you like both of them, then fucking give this a go. I think it's a 7.5 out of 10, nothing spectacular, but well executed.
