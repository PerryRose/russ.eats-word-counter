Righto, the Prime energy drink range, I'm actually keen as fuck on this. I'm starting to get behind sugar-free energy drinks, but all the new ones have pre-workout shit in it that literally give me an anxiety attack and make my fucking face numb. And, 355ml canned, in my opinion, the perfect size. Also, if you don't know what Prime is, it's a drink that this bloke brought out when he left Channel 7. Kicking it off with the Blue Raspberry. Also, does anyone give a fuck about the normal Prime anymore? I feel like now that you can get it at Woolies, no one gives a single fuck. Is anyone choosing it over Gatorade or Powerade? I'm genuinely interested, let me know. Anyway, 6 out of 10, that works way better than the normal Prime, but the sweetness is overpowering the Blue Raspberry taste, so it's kind of getting lost there. The Strawberry Watermelon. 8 out of 10, that one's fucking mad. It's like a fake strawberry-watermelon flavour, and there's hardly any aftertaste. That's good. Tropical Punch. Also, they're all this colour. They're not actually coloured drinks, okay? Okay, that one was undrinkable in the normal Prime. It was absolute dog shit, but I'm giving that a 5. It's not bad when it's carbonated. Lemon Lime. 7 out of 10, it's quite a sweet Lemon Lime though, so closer to a Sprite than like your fucking Lyfts and shit. And the Orange Mango. That honestly tastes like the first puff out of the packaging of one of these. Super sweet and artificial, and I don't think that's a good thing, so I'm going to give that one a 4 out of 10. I'm actually shocked. I thought they were going to be absolute shit, but I'm impressed. If you like a sweeter energy drink and sugar-free ones, give them a go. The Prime Possum is onto something.
