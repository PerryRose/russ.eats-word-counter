Righto, Griffin's Bickies have hit Australia. I'm keen as fuck on the Gay Time. Do yous understand how big of a deal this is? Griffin's aren't some cheap rip-off brand. They are a top-tier New Zealand Bickie. Have yous had these fucking squiggles? They are insane. They also did this range of popcorn, which were fucking awesome, especially this glazed popcorn. The only reason I never reviewed these is three times in a row I finished the packet before I actually made a fucking video. Anyways, let's get straight into it. Golden Gay Time smells exactly like one. Holy fuck, that's the middle. A toffee and vanilla cream. That is spot-on. That is unlike every other Gay Time release. Doesn't taste anything like Gay Time. That does. That is an 8.5. 9. 9 out of 10. Next, we've got the raspberry and cream. Okay, fuck me dead. That is like a Monte Carlo. That has the chew of a Monte Carlo everything, but it's like an indulgent fucking version. You've got vanilla cream, little bits of fucking raspberry jellies, and then this like chewy raspberry centre. Oh, 8.5 out of 10. But if you like Monte Carlos, that'll be a 10. And the double-choc brownie. Fucking hell, that is like a freshly-baked, chewy fucking brownie. That's a 9 out of 10 as well. This whole range is incredible. The only negative is texture-wise, I don't think some people will love it. It's like that caramel-crown, almost chalky kind of texture. But flavour-wise, fucking absolutely gorgeous.
