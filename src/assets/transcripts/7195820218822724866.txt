Righto, Bennett Street Dairy reached out to me about their limited edition Valentine's Day cookie dough now firstly Valentine's Day video I didn't have a pink shirt, but I had a pink shirt, so that's why I'm wearing this. Secondly Valentine's Day It's funny watching it deteriorate as you get more mature in your relationship. First year of me and Demi, $500 fucking hatted restaurant We went out fucking stayed in Newcastle Then you fast forward to year four and we had a McFlurry and a cookie in the car park But I have promised this year. I'm gonna up my game. I'm gonna go with a fucking nice home-cooked meal Maybe a bit of Jamiroquai on in the background a bit of background music and then obviously dessert is sorted I also want to mention I was very fucking clear that I won't sell out for a paid promotion So it'll just be a fucking honest review which they agreed to but what they don't know is I'm putting head-to-head With some of the other big dogs in the category and they don't know I'm an ex-biscuit engineer So if I say it's shit, they're basically fucked There's really only two competitors the raspberry cheesecake from Subway and the Woolies cranberry and white chocolate, let's see how this compares Here's the cost on a dry basis. They're about equivalent to the Subway cookie while they're in the oven. Let's try these That Woolies one fucking tastes cheap Subway Bit better. This is about a third of the tube and I'm gonna let them cool down So it's a fair battle and I apologize about the shape that's on me. Let's do it. They are packed full of raspberry and white choc They obviously fucking win nothing beats a fresh-baked cookie get them from Coles only in the chilled bakery section Spoiling your dial on this Valentine's Day
