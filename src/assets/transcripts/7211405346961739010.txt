Righto, the new Red Rock Deli Trio of Cheeses, Cheddar, Parmesan and Brie. Now I'm excited to see some new chip flavours, but there's one problem. And that is, they are $6.30. $6.30 for a pack of fucking chips. These cost me $6.30. I can get a large Henny Penny Chips and Gravy for $6.30. This is ridiculous. I've even been sent photos of them being over $8 in rural IGA's. Fucked up. Anyways, let's see if they're worth the $6.30. Yeah, they'll fucking do. It's a simple flavour, just cheese chips. You can't really fuck that up. I am only getting two cheeses, I'm not getting the Brie. They taste like melted cheese over hot chips. I don't know if any of yous used to do that back before the snack pack days, but I always used to get a fucking Fish and Chip Shop chips and melt a fuckload of cheese over it. That's what these taste like, which I'm all for. 7.5 out of 10, but because they're $6.30, they can get fucked.
