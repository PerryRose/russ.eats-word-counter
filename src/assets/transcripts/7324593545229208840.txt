Righto, the Hungry Jacks Summer Range. First time doing a bulk HJs review. We've got the Aussie Whopper and Jack's Fried Chicken, the Fairy Floss Storm and the Raspberry Float. Also, this launch is a bit of a fuck you. Firstly, Macca's losers trying to sue Hungry Jacks over the Big Jack. And then Hungry Jacks basically goes, well fuck you Maccas, we're bringing an Aussie burger out too, but we're actually going to put an egg on ours, unlike yous, you scabby cunts. Mind you, these four items cost me $34, so Hungry Jack's not fucking far behind. P.S. There is a tropical component to this launch, but I actually care about my health. I don't want to become Australia's Nikado Avocado. The Cotton Candy Storm and the Raspberry Float. Kicking off with the Aussie Whopper. Okay, I'm going to give it a 6.5 out of 10, but if that was a double Whopper and added pineapple, it'd be one of the closest fast food burgers to a works burger that you could get, which would be like an 8. The Aussie Jack's, it's fucking plump. 8.5 out of 10, there's a lot going on, but fucking hell, that chicken is actually pretty fucking good. And the Fairy Floss Storm, which did look like this behind me, okay, but it's fucking melted. Okay, that is fucking fun. One of the sweetest desserts I've ever had, but the Fairy Floss, once it melts and goes like almost gooey with the ice cream, is amazing. That is unique, and I'm giving that an 8.5 out of 10 because of that. And the Raspberry Float, it did look like this, but it's gone a little fucking sus now. Okay, for flavour, it's awesome. It's just like a Kurtz Cream and Soda. I'm glad someone's finally bringing the spider back, but there's that many ice cubes in it with the ice cream that you literally get like three sips and it's fucking gone. It's just why it's getting a 6 out of 10.
