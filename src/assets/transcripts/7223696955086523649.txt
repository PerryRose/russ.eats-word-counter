Righto, two new Daryl Eat Vlogs. Caramel Cheesecake and Black Forest collabed with The Cheesecake Shop. Now, when I see The Cheesecake Shop, I think of my mate Tyler's 21st. Now, his mum bought him a Cheesecake Shop cheesecake for everyone at the party. And I convinced him to smash his face into the cake. And he did. And then his mum started crying and he couldn't come out. The whole party was ruined. And he got grounded. He got grounded at 21 years old. Anyway, let's do it. In honour of Tyler, we'll kick it off with the Caramel Cheesecake. This smells like Baileys. Like an alcohol, which is really fucking full on. Anyway. I really don't know about that. I'm going to give it a 5 out of 10. Really good texture, but there's something about that caramel flavour that just punches you in the face. I don't know if it's good or bad and I'm not tasting any cheesecake. On to Black Forest. The artificial cherry flavour smells exactly like a cherry starburst chew. It cleared my nostrils. It is full on. Anyway, let's do it. Nah, they've overdosed it with fake cherry flavour. It could have been like this, but all you get is like you've done a shot of cough medicine. That is a 2 out of 10. That has been ruined. That could have been good. That's sad.
