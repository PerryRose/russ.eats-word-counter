Right-o, a Lunch Order Sunday special episode. This one's gonna be a bit more interactive, like a choose-your-own-adventure. I want you to choose your ideal lunch order. We're gonna do a main, a drink, and a snack. For this video, I've managed to track down my original SunSafe Legionnaires hat. There's my name on the inside. That's me on my debut, kindergarten, Thornton Public School, so much ahead of me. Look at that little cutie. I remember tucking the flap in too, by the way, and wearing this like as a cap, and he just thought you were so fucking cool. Anyway, let's do it. The amount of lunch orders per year was a direct measurement of how rich your parents were. I've got a couple of examples behind me. Lily, the basic bitch, chicky nuggets, strawberry milk, and a red jelly cup. Then we've got Frank's order. Meat pie, pop-top, get fucked, and bring it to room 10 ASAP. Personally, I got a lunch order about every two months. Every other day, it was a Devon and sauce sandwich and a kick up the ass. Firstly, you've got to choose a main. I always went the pizza single, no questions asked, and my least favorite were these filthy processed crumb chicken nuggets with tomato sauce. Fucked. Next, you've got to choose a drink. I always went a quench, and I put a thumbtack in the lid, and then shake it up, and it would squirt into your mouth automatically, but I didn't mind a flavored milk, usually banana. Next, you've got to choose a snack. I always went the orange fruit cup. You go through about five plastic spoons digging at these fuckers. The eucalyptus drops, these were my least favorite. Don't mind them, but only the snotty kids got those. That's my ultimate order. Screenshot this, and let me know yours in the comments.
