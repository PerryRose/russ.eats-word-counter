Righto, it's not too often you hear someone say they're excited to find new lumps, but here I am. Hokey Pokey Lumps and the Snifters Lumps Chopped Peppermint have returned. Now before I get started, the word the Hokey Pokey reminds me of the song, which reminds me of year 7 and 8 sport where you had to do dancing. I don't know if it was just my school, but it reminds me of how fucking cruel school could be. There was always a stinky kid, a stinky boy or a stinky girl, and in school sport it was so fucking cruel because everyone would be so embarrassed and pretend not to hold the stinky boy or stinky girl's hand. In my opinion, I actually used to think the stinky girl was a bit hot, so I'd fucking own it, but it just reminds me of how fucking cruel school could be. Boot scootin' baby, I don't feel like dancin' and the Hokey Pokey will forever be ruined with that heel toe heel toe fuckin' Miss Bull just used to bang that over and over again. Anyway, the point of that story is kids can be fuckwits and teachers can be fuckwits if they don't step in. Miss Bull though, she was hard, but at least she was fair. Let's go. I'm not gonna pretend like I haven't tried them before. I was supposed to review these two weeks ago and then I got a bit pissed and I ate them on the lounge before reviewing them because there was nothing else in the cupboard, so I'm sorry. If you like the pineapple lumps texture and you like honeycomb flavouring, you'll fucking love these. I think these are awesome. Eight out of ten, but they're not for everyone. Same deal with these. It's just chopped peppermint, but in that same texture, so fucking get around it if you like that flavour and that texture. You get it.
