Righto, Toblerone Gold. It's weird, this is the first time I've ever bought a Toblerone. They've always been given one as a gift. They're not a chocolate that I just go and buy, but anyway, it just felt a bit weird. And it was at Kmart. Not Coles, not Woolies. I could only find this at Kmart, which is also fucking weird. Most of the flavours we've had here in Australia have been boring. Normal, fruit and nut, white, dark and most recently orange. You can actually still get this one. Europe though has had the most different flavours. Most notably, they've had corn and corn. Anyways, let's get into it. It smells mad, but does that look like the gaps are bigger? I feel like they're stitching this up. I'm going to do a little bit of investigation here. There were shitloads of articles on this. Apparently they changed to that in 2016 and then back to the original in 2018. But if you ask me, this one that I've got looks like it's somewhere in between these, but who really fucking cares? Let's go. That is fucking naughty. Honestly, that works so well. It's like paramilk, but with the classic chewy little Toblerone bits. That's fucking awesome. That's a 9.5 out of 10. The only negative is that it's really fucking sweet and you won't like it if you don't like paramilk. Mum, if you're watching for Christmas, fuck off the Lynx Africa this year. Give me one of these. I'm calling it now. This will be the Christmas treat of the year.
