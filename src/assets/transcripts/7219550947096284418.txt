Righto, Cruiser Double. This is fucking dangerous, especially on a long weekend. Two standard drinks and 23 bucks. Finally, a replacement for the Double Black. These were awesome until that one night. Everyone watching this has had a fucked up Double Black experience between the ages of 15 and 20. These, if I smell anything even slightly similar to this, I spew. I just spew. Let's kick it off with the Lemon Lime. That's fucking dangerous. Just tastes like a solo with a bit of lime. You can taste the vodka, but it's actually pretty smooth. Raspberry. The can looks like the Kill'em All album cover, which I fucking love. That's like a red cordial raspberry, but there's something about the aftertaste I'm not all about there. Lastly, we've got Guava. What a fucking sexy can, too. That one's the winner. It's just like a normal Guava Cruiser, but it's two standard drinks, which is fucking dangerous. Here's my ratings for the rest of them. Oh, this range will ruin marriages and friendships. I'm personally going to stay away, but I'm not your mum. Do whatever the fuck you want, but shit will happen.
