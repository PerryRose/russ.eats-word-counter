Righto, Macca's Summer Launch Phase 2, we've got the Pineapple Sundae, Fritters, the Aussie Angus is back, and then a Crispy Bacon, I don't really give a fuck. I don't care because I'm losing passion for Macca's launches. These are kind of exciting, but fuck, we used to get way better shit than this back in the old days. I've actually pinned these two Macca's graveyards to the top of my profile, if you want to reminisce on the good old days. Also, I'm not reviewing the Angus because I did that last year, it's pinned also to the top of my profile, and there was a news article about it, it was only Daily Mail, they'll do a news article about a fucking fart in a jar. But what has pissed me off is they've had a year to fix this, they're still showing the egg on the fucking app, I screenshotted this today, fuck me dead Macca's. Here's a video of the Pineapple I took earlier because it's very fucking melted now, what annoys me about the new cups is in the large is you can't see if they've forgotten the sauce on the bottom or not, so they're going to get away with it now. Uh, A for America 51, K-A 51. Is that everything? Yeah, that's all, thank you. Have a lovely day. God bless you. Kicking it off with the Sundae, can't complain, that is a very summery flavour, I'm giving that a 7 out of 10, super sweet pineapple, you get the little bits of pineapple through all the fucking syrupy shit, and then slightly tart, that's quite, quite refreshing. And the fritters, that's the middle of it, typical pineapple fritter, I don't mind that at all, but I feel like it's going to go better mashed through the fucking sundae. So let's try that. Yeah, fuck, that's the hack, you've got to put the fritter in, by itself it's okay, I've had better, but like a 6 out of 10 fritter, it's okay, but mashed through is an 8 and a half, that's what you've got to do, fuck me.
