Righto, Dream White Christmas. About time we got a new Dream flavour. Keramilk has taken over the spotlight. Dream's just been left in the dark. I feel a bit sorry for it to be honest. They've even given the original a makeover with some new packaging. This reminds me of like, my mate had an old family dog that was near fucking dead and then they got a puppy while that dog was still alive, which was way fucking cuter, got heaps of attention. This is the old dog, Keramilk is the cute little golden retriever. We do love Dream though, even though this is probably our last Christmas together. But that's the circle of life. Anyway, raspberry pieces, almond pieces and rice crisps. Sounds mad, but I have no idea what the fuck that's got to do with Christmas flavours. Let's get into it. Oh yeah. That does look mad, but I can't help but think how much better it would be in Keramilk. Let's go. I don't know why, but I am getting Christmas vibes from this. It's a fun, it's a fun block. There's a lot going on. You got the raspberry for the kids, almond for your grandad, rice bubbles for your, for your mum. That's why it's a Christmas block. It's for the whole family. That's all I can think of. It's pretty good. 7.5 out of 10. Probably wouldn't buy it again, but it's not bad for an old dog.
