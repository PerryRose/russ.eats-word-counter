Righto, some breaking news, Starbursts have been cloned, reincarnated, one of the best kept secrets in Australian food history, and I'm gonna spill the beans. A follower sent me a message and said there was a specific underground unknown product that tastes exactly like the Starbursts Fruitful Mix. I thought, bullshit. So I went to the shops this afternoon, and there they are on the shelf. Plant-based, vegan-friendly lollies. I wouldn't piss on lollies like this usually, but for $2.75, I thought, whatever, I'll give it a go. And oh my, they are fucking identical. The only slight difference is they seem to stick to your teeth slightly more. They are full of tang, and you know I love me fucking tang. These are the closest things we are going to get back to the Starbursts Fruitful Mix, and they are plant-based, Woolies brand lollies. I can't believe it. Probably the biggest thing that's happened this year.
