Righto, The Junk Food Graveyard Part 8, we're doing KFC. I've got to start with crushers, especially the Gay Time Crusher. These were made in the crush bar, and had a thick as fuck straw that you could get through one in about 2 minutes. Then we've got the OG Twister range, or you can get to the Crunchwrap now and it's shit, bring em back! The range of Twisters back in the day was phenomenal, you could get crispy or grilled, BLT, Salsa, Spicy, Supercharged, Bacon Lovers, Honey Mustard, Sweet Chili, Caesar, the fucking list goes on. The best one though was the Toasted Twister. It was literally a Twister that was toasted for 12 seconds, but it made a lot of difference, trust me. Mashies, little potato and gravy balls, I never tried these because I hated mashed potato growing up, ever since my brother filled his mouth with it and pretended he was a pimple. The OG Pie Release, the Kentucky Pie that had potato and the Zinger Pie. They brought the Zinger Pie back, but I reckon it was a little bit different, but it was still mad. Then we've got the Popcorn Chicken Rollers, BBQ, Bacon and Nacho Cheese, they're good with these. Then we've got Hot and Spicy, which pops up every now and then. This is a permanent menu item in Queensland, did you know that? Fucking needs to be permanent everywhere, it's bullshit. The Tower Burger, just when you thought KFC couldn't get filthier, they put a big dirty hash brown on a burger. It was mad, bud. Some KFC's did breakfast, but it was so bad, they need to bring it back, but do it better. Imagine a Bacon Egg Roll with a dirty Zinger Fillet, that's what we want. Honourable mention to the filthiest item in history, the Double.
