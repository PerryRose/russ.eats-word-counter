Righto, the Golden Gaytime chocolate oak flavour. So I've seen these at Servo's for a few weeks, but you guys know I refuse to pay $5.50 for a fucking Golden Gaytime. So every couple of days, been looking in the ice cream section for these at Coles and they haven't been there, so today I gave in and like an absolute cockhead, spent $5.50 on a Gaytime. Then, I go to get dinner on the way home at Coles and I shit you not, they're in stock as of today, so I'm not happy and it better be good. So because I had to drive home from the Servo, it is, the stick has receded into the Gaytime and look, look, it's fucked. It is melted off the stick, but let's give it a go anyway. Not fucking hearing about this, it's horrible. This is an absolute mess, but it's my own fault for driving for 30 minutes with an ice cream thinking nothing would fucking happen. That's why I had an innie, an innie for a stick. Anyways, it's pretty good. I'm not getting chocolate oak vibes. It's not like the chocolate Gaytime, it's like the choc fever, so it's a bit of a scam, kind of the same thing. 7 out of 10, it's still pretty fucking yum, even though it's fucked.
