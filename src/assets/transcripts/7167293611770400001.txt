Righto, I'm on the hunt for some festive piss. After the Spiced Ginger Beer Bundaberg, I thought this is gonna fucking hit the spot. Now, Brookvale Union are one of my favourite brands, so I know this is gonna be good. I also think this has been out for a while, but don't make me tell the fucking fat lamb story. You know why? I'm late to the ginger beer party. I didn't read the can, it's with lime juice. A completely different flavour profile to this. This is not the weapon of choice to washing down Christmas ham on Nana's Lounge. The hunt for festive piss continues, this isn't it. It's only a 5 out of 10. I don't even know if it's Christmas related, it just fucking sounded like it because Spiced and Ginger Beer was in the name. Leave me alone.
