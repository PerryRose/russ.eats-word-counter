Righto, we're about to reveal the Freddo ice cream cake flavour. If you didn't see, last night we did a thorough investigation on what the Freddo ice cream cake was. I was wrong. I said that I was 90% sure that it was vanilla. But we've had some intel come through overnight which has confirmed the flavour. Here it is, the proof, the big reveal. Hi Russell, thanks for contacting us with your inquiry. The flavour of the Cadbury Freddo cake is... Caramel. Just like the Rainbow Paddle Pop, the fucking Freddo ice cream cake is just another coloured caramel ice cream. Bit of a scam if you ask me. I'm not happy, not sad, I'm just relieved that I finally know. Thanks to Janine from the ice cream consumer care team. And for whoever guessed caramel, good on ya, I was fucking wrong, blah blah, piss off.
