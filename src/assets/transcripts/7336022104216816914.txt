Righto, two new Cruiser Doubles, but first, I'm gonna leak some shit. Now, Cruiser and the brands behind me are all owned by the same company. We've got Brookvale Union going into the rum, bourbon and whiskey and dry market, which is fucking huge. And I've already mentioned that Hard Solo, which is now hard-rated, is coming out in zero sugar very soon. But they're also coming out in a zero sugar lemon-lime very soon. Now, we've already had four Cruiser Doubles before. These are all the full sugar ones, which I loved the Guava, and then we had a low sugar Passion Fruit, which I didn't like at all. Let's kick it off with the low sugar Black Currant first. These are two standard drinks, 6.9, 6.8%. Nine and a half out of ten, straight up melted fucking Black Currant Zupidoo. But you cannot taste that low sugar fucking sweetener aftertaste at all. There is 8.6 grams in the can, but that's fucking insane. No alcohol taste, that's great. That's very impressive compared to the Passion Fruit. Also, if we're talking flavour, not alcohol content, and you love the Pastilles more, get the Billsons. But if you like the Zupidoo for Black Currant more, get the Cruiser, okay? That's how it works. And the Green Apple. Eight out of ten, I cannot complain with that at all. It's a classic Green Apple flavour, I cannot taste the alcohol at all. Very sweet, could do with a little bit of Tang, but I don't mind that at all. These are the next Double Blacks, so you will have a night where you'll never drink these again. So up until that night, I think enjoy.
