Righto, Twisty's Cheese Toasty. I've got the party bag and it's fucking huge by the way, only $3.50 for this quarter of a kilo. Now I'm big on flavours actually being accurate to what they're claiming to be. These have not been Cheese Toasty flavour. In my opinion, a Cheese Toasty is like bigger tasty cheese, butter and white bread. These were just cheese, they weren't a Cheese Toasty. So these basically have no smell at all. Anyways, let's go. They're fucking boring as. All Twisty's kind of taste the same to me these days. So I can't even tell if it's a Cheese Toasty because there's just not enough flavouring. Compared to American snacks where you have all that filthy orange shit all over them like the Herr's range and Cheetos, these just seem shit. I'm giving them a 5 out of 10. I'm off Twisty's. I'm fucking off them.
