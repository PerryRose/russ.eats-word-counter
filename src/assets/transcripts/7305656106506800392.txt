Righto, the hunt for a palatable fast food coffee is coming to an end. Guzman is the last remaining one. Hungry Jacks and Maccas have been shit. Let's see if we can find one we can actually drink. KFC and Red Russo don't have coffee, thank fuck. Kentucky Fried Coffee would be the worst thing ever. If there's another fast food chain that has coffee, let us know. And I fucking won't go there because they have been fucked so far. There's a sauce called piccolo. Oh, oh right. So you might get a little sore. I've strategically sat next to the fire hose wheel. There's a coffee and a burrito. $2.70 for the coffee, but also $2.70 for the piccolo. That's very cheap. I'm fucking scared about that. In terms of cleanliness, this is in the middle of today. Yes, Hungry Jacks was, you would eat off the floor. Yeah, yeah. Maccas was like, you'd step on a fucking needle. So to know if you've got a good coffee, you have to listen closely to the steam wand. If it's very loud for a flat white, they don't know what they're doing. Maybe it's an auto one. Hope not. Actually, sometimes it's safer than that. It would be safer here. They accidentally made you a large. Okay. Yeah. I'm quite impressed. It definitely looks milky, but it looks like good milk. Yeah. Holy shit, $2.70. Anyway, let's do an unveiling of yours. Oh wow. It's a good looking one. Guzman was the favorite to be the worst. Maccas has McCafe and Hungry Jacks has Jack's Cafe. So they're claiming to know coffee. Guzman does not talk about coffee fucking at all. And we've got... That girl looked like she knew what she was doing. We haven't tasted it yet, so let's not get too excited. Yeah, all right. Cheers. Oh my, it's just milk. That's the milkiest of all. But at least it's good milk. Switch for switch. I couldn't... No, it's actually... It's not great, but I've um... That's the best from today. Eat both. Isn't it? Yeah, even that. It tastes a little bit of coffee. But that always has like a... At least a pleasant coffee taste. Like you can tell it's the coffee. The other two was just... It was just burnt. It's still not strong enough. No, no. That's what a normal coffee at a normal cafe tastes like, is that. Is that. That's okay. This is palatable. We found a palatable one. We found a palatable fast food coffee. You have to get a piccolo at Guzman. Specifically a piccolo. And I'm glad because it's come to the end of the day where we feel very sick. I'm fucking done. I'm still not going to finish it, but it's palatable. If this was a caramel latte, it would be good. So come on, next week, most palatable servo coffee. Next drink of luck chance to get through the servos today. I think I've had too many coffees. I can't be far. Yeah, I can't be far. But I'm not tipping this out because I hate it. I'm tipping it out because I've had too much. Is it bad for plants? I don't know.
