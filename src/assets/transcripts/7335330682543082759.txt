Righto, today I woke up to the internet going crazy over the new Adult Happy Meal with an adult toy. And I was thinking, finally something exciting, perfect timing, Valentine's Day, Big Mac meal with a fucking adult toy for all the single people. And I feel like I've been misled, so I'm nothing but disappointed. That is a child's toy, okay? Have you googled adult toy? I was thinking like a Grimace Double Ender or a Birdie Plug, but I was wrong. I was thinking finally Macca's is getting a little bit naughty, a little bit exciting, but I was wrong. What the fuck is that? So yeah, if you were expecting an adult toy with your Adult Happy Meal like I was, get ready to be disappointed.
