Righto, it's a Friday, you know I don't mind a bit of piss, and I can't believe how many people have asked for this. It's the Australian alcoholic version of Prime. I say that for two reasons. One, it's sold out just like Prime was and everyone's asking for it. And two, it's made by two YouTubers. Aussie YouTubers from Cold Ones, Anything4ViewsChad, and MaxMofo. I also want to mention, they're two of very few people that actually knows who this fucker is. Anyway, it's about the drink. It's called Grog, which is cool, but I wish it was called Piss. That's- If I'm bringing out a drink, it's gonna be called Piss, by the way. Similar to a Suntory, but grape and peach flavor. Basically, no sugar, 6%, shoku, I think that's how you say it, vodka, and soda. We'll kick it off with the grape. Apparently, you're supposed to have it over ice. There's a little pamphlet with the box, so I'll do that first. That's mad. That's better than the Suntory grape. It's got more sweetness, and it's like a grape Gatorade Maximus type of grape, which I fucking like. I'm being dead honest. I'm not just trying to suck off two YouTubers, promise ya. And the peach. Not bad. The grape's an 8.5, but that's a 7 in my opinion. It's more like a Lipton iced tea peach, but I was expecting like a fake-ass lolly peach. But, overall, pretty impressed.
