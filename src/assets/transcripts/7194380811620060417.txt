Righto, the Red Rooster and Smith's collab, the Red's Fried Chicken Burger. Now, quick shoutout to Red Rooster, they've finally realised that most money in take-away comes from hungover people, and hungover people don't want a fucking baked dinner. We want dirty fried chicken. If we wanted a baked dinner, we'd go to our mums and get one for fucking free. Anyways, in the snack world, fried chicken's been a flavour that has sometimes not been executed very well. This was shit, this was okay, that was fucked, and these were probably the closest fried chicken flavour in a chip that I've personally ever tried. But what's different about this launch is that it's a fried chicken burger, so they not only need to capture the fried chicken flavour, they also somehow need to capture the bun, the lettuce, the mayo, and it looks like there's a sneaky bit of fucking cheese on there too. So let's see if this is accurate. Okay, so they look and smell exactly like normal chicken chips. Okay, they are literally chicken chips, if you didn't see the packaging, you wouldn't know any different. Now, these marketing ploys always fucking piss me off, but we're in the middle of a potato shortage, which pisses me off even more, because it's a wasted spud. This spud could have become a hash brown, fucking hot chippies, fucking anything but this shit. Three out of ten, another scam, start putting effort into your products and not just chucking a pretty logo on the fucking packaging.
