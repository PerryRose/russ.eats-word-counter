Righto, the time has come where we announce the Russ Eats Billson's Flavour. In my hand right here, we have the inspiration for the Russ Eats Flavour. I'm happy to present to you, the occult fermented milk drink, probiotic Billson's Flavour. I'm just kidding you stupid little fuckwits, we're obviously doing the Paddle Pop Cyclone. One of the best frozen treats on this planet. Peach, pineapple and blueberry with apple juice. I'm so fucking keen on this, but it's inspired by Cyclone. We're gonna call it something else. So I'm thinking like Hurricane, Typhoon, Twister, Wind, Whirlwind, Tornado, something like that. Or, get creative like Gus did at Billson's with the Rusty Windmill. But this in my opinion is too close to being the Rusty Trombone. I don't know about that. But comment below some of your name ideas. Then next video I'll tell you what I'm gonna fucking name it. Show you a couple of can designs. And they are sending me the latest prototype via mail. Where I'll also give that a fucking little taste as well. Let's do it.
