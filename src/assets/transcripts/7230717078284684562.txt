Righto, another collab, Lifesavers and Daryl Lee, banana lolly chocolate block. Now I want to get something clear, I know I shit-talk these lollies, and I do still stand by that these lollies are one of the shittest things on earth. They're like one molecule away from being fucking play-doh. But, everything else banana flavor I fucking love, including the choc-coated bananas. I like these, but I hated them without the choc. Don't ask why, that's just my fucking opinion. So it is safe to say I am keen as fuck on this block, even though I hate banana lollies. I also want to mention that it's funny, Alan stopped selling bananas, everyone kicked up a stink, then Lifesavers seen the opportunity, now they sell bananas in the shops, they've lost all the market, and I just find that funny. You snooze, you lose. Let's do it, it smells so fucking full-on, and it's banana fudge, not banana lollies actually, I got that wrong, sorry. Okay, it's good, 7.5 out of 10, it hits the spot. It's nowhere near as good as the Perky Na-Na block, because they had like chewy bits of banana, this is just like sugary fudge pieces, and it's not like the banana lolly flavor, it's a little bit different, not exactly the same, but it's still a nice banana choc, and I will be polishing off the rest of the block tonight.
