Righto, we've got two new ones from Brookvale Union, these fit into two separate ranges. The Tropical Punch is the sequel to the Lemon Squash. Low sugar, 6%. This is the future of piss. You think it's healthier and you only need about four to get absolutely fucked. This is one of my favourite drinks. Shits on the Suntory 196. And my mate Mullet puts a shot of Chambord in it. Oh, absolutely, that's a hint. Fucking try that. Then we've got the new Red Pub Soda, which fits in with these ones. Similar to your Cruisers, UDLs and Billsons, they're 4% and full sugar. And a treat. Starting with the Tropical Punch, that's a fluorescent yellow. That's your piss the next day after these. It's okay, but it's not as smooth as the Lemon Squash. I'm only going to give that a 5.5 out of 10. It tastes like a sour, a bit of a sus, frosty fruit. That's what that tastes like. And the Red Pub Soda. That is exactly the same as a Kirk's Cream and Soda. I thought a Red Pub Soda would be a fire engine though. Remember the lemonade with the red cordial? Not a cream and soda. I'm going to give that an 8 out of 10 though, because it's naughty.
