Right-o. Choc Mint Oak in a cute little Christmas carton. Now I think this is the first time they've just done a Choc Mint Oak. They've done a Cool Choc Mint Max, a Thick and a Peppermint Crisp, but I can't recall just a Choc Mint Oak. Let's go. I'll show you the colour, but I'm going to drink it out of the carton for the proper effect. You've got to drink it out of the carton. Mmm. First things first, if you don't like Choc Mint, you obviously won't like this. It's actually weird if you don't like Choc Mint and you're still watching. Fuck off. If you do like Choc Mint, there's something off about this. At first, I was like, this is fucking mad, and then I got this sus as aftertaste. Like Colgate Triple Action, maybe? Like a bitter, a bitter mint aftertaste. Not a pleasant mint like most Choc Mint have. I'm going to have to give that a fucking 5 out of 10. It's not good.
