Righto, the low-key treat of the month for December, groovy pistachio ice creams, or pistachio, however you say it. Some say tomato, some say tomato, some say Nelly-fatato, some say Nelly-fatato, you know how it goes. Also, I've been MIA, I jumped off a ladder, and yeah, landed on one of these upside down, and it fuckin' went in, then it got infected, so I've been heaps crook in the arch of my foot, hasn't been a good time, so, you see me limping around, that's why, anyway. Gettin' late, so let's get into it, looks fuckin' awesome. Yeah, fuck, 9 out of 10, I've nearly finished it, that is super sweet, super salty, with a really strong pistachio flavour, that's gorgeous, okay, if you like pistachios, give it a run, fuckin' gorgeous.
