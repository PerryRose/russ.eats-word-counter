Righto, Fireball with Apple, the hunt for festive piss continues. Will this be the weapon of choice to wash down a kilo of prawns and pavlova, Nana's Lounge Christmas Day? Let's find out. Also, this is the sexiest can design in history, are you ready? Glow in the fucking dark, have a go at that, I love glow in the dark shit. 6.6% and 1.8 standard drinks, let's get into it. That is dangerous, you cannot taste that 6.6%, I think this would ruin Christmas, if I had more than 4 of these I'd fight, I reckon I'd fight my own mum, I'd actually fight mum if I had more than 4 of these. It's got this awesome, nice, fresh apple taste, not like a Summersby apple and the cinnamon aftertaste is, it is giving me a Christmas vibe. 8.5 out of 10, it's a maybe as the festive piss weapon of choice.
