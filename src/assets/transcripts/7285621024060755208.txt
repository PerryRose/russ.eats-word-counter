Right out the twister mini has hit Australia. This is the UK version of the cyclone, but slightly different now You might remember the twister from this video, which is we're calling the Irish version of me now I didn't know why is we're all going so crazy over this video until I seen the stick bit. This is fucked I really hope mine don't look anything like this, but we are about to find out here. They are There's the one from the video. They are strawberry lemon lime and pineapple flavor. They look different, but I think they're both the same flavor Let's get straight into it Yep, these are fucking mad exact same texture as the cyclone same flavors, but different ratios So this one's more like a strawberry powering sorbet where this one's like a clip-on lemon lime in the middle They're fucking mad. It has a creamy aftertaste though This part's actually an ice cream, which is a new world for cyclones nine. Yep fucking nine
