Righto, another Russ Eats Creations, we're making the Milky Bar Pringles. Now this rumour started on the UK snack attack TikTok. Half a million people liked it, where they said you could get them in the shops over in the UK. They did put in the caption that it's not real, but no one reads the fucking captions and I was a bit pissed off when I found out that they scammed us. Now I got Milky Bar, Milky Bar Cookies and Cream Gold and Nestle White Cooking Chocolate. The reason I got the cooking chocolate is because it tastes pretty much the same, but you don't have to temper it. I'll go into detail about tempering in another video. Basically, melted them down, stirred them up and then I got the Pringles, World Cup Pringles and really from here on I just dipped them. It was pretty fucking simple to be honest. Here's a nice time lapse of me going hard. I broke about 50 Pringles, put them in the fridge and there you have it, a beautiful dipped Pringle. The problem was these all stuck to the fucking thing and I needed a chisel to get these off. I managed to salvage one of each chocolate, but the rest were absolutely fucked. Let's do it. If you love sweet and salty combos, it's a 9 out of 10. If you don't, you'll fucking hate it. So if you like these two blocks they brought out a few years ago, this is right up your alley. Now the Cookies and Cream Gold. There was a bit much going on there, probably a 6 out of 10 for that one. And the cooking chocolate. Yeah, that was the winner because the chocolate was actually set properly so you had the added dimension of it snapping when you bit into it. This is a winner. Pringles, please bring this out because I'm never going to attempt making them again. Never going to attempt making them again.
