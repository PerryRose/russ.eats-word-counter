Righto, the hunt for festive piss continues. We finally got 6% Bilsons. I've been waiting so long for this. They are in a smaller can, 250ml, and it's 1.2 standard drinks. I asked them why, and it's so you can still mix and match these in with the whole Bilsons range in a carton. People are whinging though, but one thing I've found in life, it doesn't matter what you do, people will still fucking whinge. And I'm gonna let you in on a secret. You don't have to drink them. You can get fucked. No one is forcing you to drink them. We've got Tangle Blood Orange and Strawberry Watermelon, which is a new flavour. I am disappointed. Where the fuck's the 6% Twister? That's what we want. This is mad, especially Tangle, but a 6% Twister, that'd be the drink of the year. Kicking off with Tangle, which is the renamed Fruit Tangle. I'm doing them side by side to see how different they taste. And the three and a half-er. Okay, that is fucking dangerous. They are nearly identical. That one's maybe a bit sweeter, where this one has a slight tangy aftertaste with a little bit of vodka. 9.75. I'm gonna punish the absolute arse out of this. It's 42 degrees. I'm only doing this review as an excuse to smash the absolute fuck out of all three of them. Blood Orange. 6 out of 10. It's alright, but nothing magical. You can't taste the vodka though. And the Strawberry Watermelon. 8 out of 10. That's like a lolly. These are little fucking pocket rockets. I'm happy, okay? The wait has been worth it.
