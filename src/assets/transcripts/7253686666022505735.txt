Righto, another Daryl E block. Crunchy nut, cornflake, milk, chocolate. I feel like Daryl E will collaborate with fucking anyone. They're just like Pitbull in the 2010s. This is their second Kellogg's collab and I don't mind it because it kind of allows you to have chocolate for breakfast. However, I do feel sorry for the other cereals. It's always Cocoa Pops, Rice Bubbles, Crunchy Nut and fucking Fruit Loops. What about Just Right? Or even an All Brand block. One for the oldies, for a healthy gut. Or Sustain. Fucking Sustain was good. Makes you strong. Let's get into it. It's got peanuts and the cornflakes mixed through it. Let's go. Okay, so the chocolate and the peanuts overpower this. There's way too many peanuts. So if you like a peanut chocolate, you'll like this. But if you wanted a crunchy nut cornflake chocolate, you're going to be fucking disappointed. The bits with the cornflakes are actually quite pleasant, but there's not many of them. I'm giving that a 5 out of 10. Sorry.
