Righto, the Colonel and I have kissed and made up, and I'll be delivering some huge news on his behalf, Mr. Sanders. KFC will be sneaking four international items onto the app over the next four weeks. Now here's the catch, there's always a catch. You can't actually order and try those items in Australia, but COZA, or the Colonel, sorry, I just know him pretty well these days, will be flying you business class to that country, to that KFC, to try it in real life. Now it's super easy to enter. These items will randomly appear in the app over the next four weeks. They could be in your Zinger box, they could be hidden behind your Choccy Moose. All you've got to do is add it to cart with your normal order. Now I don't know which countries or products, but my number one pick is the Crusher. If I can't get him here, I'll be making KFC fly me to a country that still has him. I could have sworn this was American. That's from Philippines. The Chizza and the Chacho sound insane too. That's what I want. Link in bio for more info. This is my only chance of going overseas. My mortgage has doubled. I had to bludger 50 off COZA the other day, so I will be personally entering this one.
