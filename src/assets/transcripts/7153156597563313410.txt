Righto, the follow-on from this review is spot-on. Sticky Date Pudding is what this tastes like to me. To be specific, it's not like the sticky part. It's like the base of a Sarah Lee pudding. The bit that you scrape out of the fucking foil at the end. But, this is not on the same level as Sez's Pud. This is a delicacy. This is one of the best desserts of all time. This is only a mediocre milk, okay? But it's similar. That's what it tastes like. You get it. Fuck off.
