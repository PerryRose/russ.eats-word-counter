Righto, the new Billson's Creamy Paradise. I know what you're thinking, the perfect opportunity for a dirty joke, but I'm not doing it. But I do have a funny fucking story. Now, I'm on the way to see Blink-182, and this was the first ever album that I got, okay? The Mark, Tom and Travis Show. And I wasn't allowed to listen to the song Family Reunion or Blowjob. And I asked my mum, what is a blowjob? And she sat me down and she said, it's when people vacuum. They sometimes call it a blowjob, it's slang. Anyway, so I went my whole adult life thinking that vacuuming and blowjob were the same thing. So you fast forward and I get a girlfriend and she sits me down and says, I gave someone a blowjob. And I just go, I don't give a fuck, like you can vacuum whoever you want. You give whoever you want a blowjob if you want. Just don't kiss him. So for three years, my girlfriend's vacuuming people's houses. And then I find out what it really means and find out she's just been sucking people off the whole time. Anyways, I actually thought she was a cleaner. But anyway, Creamy Paradise, let's go. Okay, I'm definitely getting ice cream, like something mixed with it. I'm thinking like the juices from tinned peaches or two fruits. I know that sounds shit, but it fucking tastes good in a drink. But I'm also getting like a boysenberry swirl vibe. I'm giving it an 8 out of 10. It's very different to anything I've had and I'm fucking vibing with it, okay?
