Righto, the Woolies Birthday Cake Mudcake. I was supposed to have this on my actual birthday yesterday, but as you know, I decided to take on a 10-paddy fucking monster instead. Also, thank you everyone for checking up on me. I haven't actually been to the toilet yet since the Big Beefy Beast, but I'm imagining tomorrow, hopefully tomorrow, it's gonna go something like this. I have had the worst chest pain and have not trusted a fart since. Now, there's only two ways to eat a mudcake. It's the Bruce Bobshotter way or the Nick Vevitas way. I'm gonna go the Nick way. Cheers. Oh. Yeah, can we all agree the Woolies Mudcake is a part of Australian tradition? I've had one every year and I will up until I die. This is that classic Woolies Mudcake texture, but a vanilla mudcake. You know, dense and a bit fake, but we like it. It's nostalgic. White chocolate, cookies and sprinkles on top. I give this an 8.5 out of 10. Only $6.50. I reckon I actually prefer these over those super expensive cakes. Woolies Mudcake till the day I die.
