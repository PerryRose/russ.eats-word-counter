Righto, two new blocks from Cadbury, Leamington and Choc Orange Cookies. This one feels soft, okay? I thought it was melted, but it's just soft. Also, it's the worst time of the year to bring chocolate out. That's all we've eaten for fucking two weeks, because that's all our family gave each other. It makes me kind of sick thinking about trying these. I'm over Choc-y at the moment, but anyway. Also, I forgot to say Happy New Year. Hope yous had a good fucking break. I did, except for one thing. Did anyone else's partner basically ignore him just to read this fucking thing? Is there some sort of cult that I don't know about? What the fuck's going on here? Everyone seems to have it. Went to the beach the other day, and everyone's fucking reading it. I don't know what's going on, so if someone could fill me in, let me know. This actually worked out for me, because I got an Xbox. That's all I've been fucking doing, which reminds me I do have a Twitch now, which I've been streaming every now and then, so link in bio. Kicking off with Leamington, this one has raspberry jam and vanilla cake flavored pieces with coconut. Okay, it's yum. It's an 8 out of 10, but it needs less raspberry and more vanilla cake to taste like a Leamington. It's closer to a coconut rough when I thought it was going to be like this vovo block, which was loose. And the choc orange, this has orange cream and cookie pieces. Looks fucking awesome on the inside. Nah, that's fucking yuck. It tastes exactly like an Arnott's orange slice in a block, which is the worst Bicci in history. I fucking absolutely hate them. If you like Arnott's orange slice, you will like the block. But also, if you like Arnott's orange slice, get fucking help, please. Joe, I'm talking to you.
