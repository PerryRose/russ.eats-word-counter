Righto, what a fucking year 2022 has been! I'm about to do my top 10 treats of the year and I'm excited to announce we've immortalized these treats in the RussFest 2022 festival t-shirt. There's a presale link in my bio and more info in the caption. Obviously the lineup's not blurred on the real shirt, I'll show you that at the end of the video, otherwise I'd fucking spoil it. And limited second release of the Russ Eats Corduroy hats. Both of these are for presale now and will be ready around February to March. I'm gonna smash through 10th to 6th, starting with Turtle Chips. These fucking took over the internet. They were pretty good but they didn't live up to the hype in my opinion. Then Apple Fireball. This was a fucking treat. Festive piece of choice obviously. V Pink Refresh. One of the best energy drinks I've ever had and it was sugar free which blew my mind. Rainbow Sherbet Bilsons. Pretty much all the Bilsons deserve a mention but this was my number one. Then Cadbury Layers. These come out 11 months ago. If you haven't tried one, fucking give them a go, they're a treat. Fifth place, Dare Intense Espresso. This was an absolute treat and destroyed assholes around the country. In fourth spot, the Gold Toblerone. I hope he's got a few of these under your Christmas tree. A delicate little fucking treat. In third spot, we've got the Keramilk Marvelous Creations. This was the only 10 out of 10 for the year. It was a fucking treat but as I ate some of the other products, I actually reckon that they were better. One of them being the Keramilk Breakaway. Holy fuck, this is an absolute certified treat. Silver medal. And finally, my treat of the year, the Kit Kat Milo Chunky. Holy fuck, this is good. Which brings us to the final RussFest lineup. Happy fucking new year.
