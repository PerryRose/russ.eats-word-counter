Right-o, Hot N' Crispy Boneless is back at KFC, but it doesn't come without controversy. Apparently, you can't get Wicked Wings in the Zinger box anymore, you can only get Hot N' Crispy. I've been putting the job to find out if this is true, and review the new Hot N' Crispy, but I find it really fuckin' hard to believe, because you can customise the arse out of a Zinger box, I reckon you can just switch them over and everyone's just blind up for no fuckin' reason like they do about everything. Hi, welcome to KFC, welcome to your place. Hey, um, you can switch the Hot N' Crispy Boneless for three Wicked Wings in the Zinger box, can't ya? We can indeed, yes. Yeah, I thought that. I'll just try two of the Hot N' Crispy. Just two on their own? Yeah, just two on their own. How hot are they? Are they like a little, ooh, or like a, ooh. They're the same as Wicked Wings, they're just, they're boneless. Man. There you have it, you're whinging for no fuckin' reason, you can just switch them over, so shut up. Anyway, they're pretty fuckin' big, only $2.95 for two of them, let's get into it. Fuck, man. Check that fuckin', look at that. That's fuckin' life-changing. Whoever whinged about these taking over Wicked Wings, they shit on Wicked Wings. They're just a Wicked Wing without any bones. Fuck the bones, that's mad. Nine and a half out of ten. A bit more spice, maybe, fuck I don't know.
