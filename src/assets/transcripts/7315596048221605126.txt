Righto, to help with your filthy festive hangovers, I'm doing a public service announcement on the best fast food brekkie. It's not from Macca's, that shit tastes like it was grown in a fucking lab. It's not from Hungry Jack's. If you go to Hungry Jack's for breakfast, you're fucked in the head. It's actually from Goodsman. I know what you're thinking, I didn't even know they do breakfast. They fucking do. I've been keeping this to myself for the last year or two and it's about time I spill the fucking beans. Firstly, a warning, a coffee and a spicy burrito does things to your guts that nothing else will ever do. But it's fucking worth it. Now, I'm gonna get one of each of the main items and let you know if they're good. Because I usually just get the burrito with bacon and as we know, Goodsman can be pretty fucking shit. So here's the spread of items that I've got. I also got the saut√© vegetable filling just to see what it's like. Kicked it off with the bacon burrito. Have a look at that. Hash brown cheese, spicy fucking sauce, incredible. I added guac, but it looks like they used the tortilla as a fucking tissue. There's a little snot rocket of guac. Come on Goodsie, we need a little more than that. Then I got the chorizo. This one looked a lot better. This one hit the spot. I reckon on fillings, they're about even. Next, I did the quesadilla that looked like a fucking something you'd find in that bin next to the girls toilets. It just tasted like something you would make at home. This is pretty shit. Now, usually I love the tacos with the other filling, but the veg filling was dog shit. It was like corn from a fucking can. That's my rating of the fillings overall. And this is my rating of the products overall. I only recommend getting the burritos or the tacos with the bacon or chorizo. That's the way to go.
