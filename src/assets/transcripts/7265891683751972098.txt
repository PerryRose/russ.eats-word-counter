Righto, here's a funny story. I was going to leak the return of this product last week, but Red Rooter dropped into my DMs and basically said, Russ, stop being a fuckwit and we're all in launchers and let's work together. Basically, we're going to run a little competition for the launch of this new product. We'll talk prizes first. The winner will win these lightly sharded undies from the last Red Rooster video, and you'll get a Russ Eats bucket hat and cord hat. And if you live in the area, I'll hand deliver this new item in the undies. I'll have nothing but the undies. It's pretty simple how to enter. You've got to comment on any of Red Rooster's posts on what this code means and what the product is. It's coming back. I'll give you a hint. It is in the running for treat of the year 2023. And behind me, there's another fucking hint.
