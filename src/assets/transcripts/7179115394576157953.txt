Righto, just when we thought the hunt for festive piss was over, in extra time, only five days out from Christmas, Billson's has dropped berry jelly flavour. So when I hear berry jelly, I don't know if it's strawberry or raspberry, but this is what I think of. Either those hard jelly lumps that you got at Peet's Hut or you can eat on the dessert, these weird reject shop jellies, aeroplane jelly or jelly cups, sometimes with sus bits of pear in it. I don't know which one it's going to taste like, let's find out. Let's go. Oh. They've done it again. Honestly, I can't complain. I thought this was going to be just like another berry drink, but it is definitely jelly flavoured, but I'm getting more of like a port wine, aeroplane jelly vibe, jelly shots vibe, but it is fucking delivered. I'm going to give it an 8 out of 10, like it's not mind-blowing, but it's exactly what it says it is, and yes, it will be joining me on Christmas Day with the rainbow sherbet.
