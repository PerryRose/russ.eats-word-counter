Right, our brand new series, the Hot Chip 100. We will be ranking every mainstream hot chip. To qualify, you just need to have at least 30 stores. And what better way to kick it off than putting Big Burger head-to-head? Episode 1, Macca's vs Hungry Jack's. We'll be ranking these on taste, texture and consistency. Some of these places are not reliable at all. We're beginning this adventure at Macca's. Now, we can agree their consistencies are zero. They can have some of the worst chips. So I parked next to the bins because that's probably where they're going. Underfilled as fuck. That is piss weak. Look at that. And for a texture test, they're limp. Almost hollow in the middle. And I could not believe how much salt was on these. It tasted like I was swallowing ocean water. Not even a seagull would eat these fuckers. Absolute horrible. Sometimes they can be good, but these were horrible. Check my monopoly. If I got fries or a fruit bag, I was choosing the fruit bag. Straight in the bin, these were fucked. Nearly ran out of fuel, so I treated the Camry to some 98 for the holidays. And look at, how big was that bird? It looks like someone threw a fucking soft serve at my car. Also, so many people in here. It took me 15 minutes to get my chips. But I think it's going to be worth it. We finally secured the goods into the car park to give them a go. They honestly look a million times better than the Macca's ones already. They are crunchy. They're consistent. Oh, I love these chips, by the way. They are one of my go-to's. Let's give them a taste. And as usual, absolute fucking treat. They're on the money here. They are on the money.
