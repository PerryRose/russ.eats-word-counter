Righto, another Smith's collab flavour. There's three with Subway, one with Red Rooster and this one with Mad Mex. Hot sauce flavour. Now I don't want to start an argument about which is the best of the Mexican chain stores but I just wanted to show you some statistics. Zambrero actually has the most stores. I thought it was Guzman. Guzman second, then Mad Mex and then Taco Bell. Anyways, back to the chips. The Smith's Double Crunch range came out a couple of years ago in Australia. This is the fifth flavour. I don't mind them but I really like the original the most. The rest didn't blow my mind. The best way I can describe the chip itself is like a hybrid between these two. It's somewhere in the middle. Also, a fun fact, it's called Lay's Max everywhere else in the world. We just fucking love Smith's so they rename them just for us. Let's do it. Also, you get a free burrito and a free sub and a free fucking something from Red Rooster with every bag which is cool. They're fucking mad. Finally a flavour that's not just chicken or barbecue. It's kind of like Frank's hot sauce with maybe a slight Mexican spice. The only negative is they could be hotter. I'm really fucking enjoying these. I reckon I'll polish the rest of the bag off. This is an eight and a half out of ten.
