Righto, Lotus Biscoff Ice Creams. These look fuckin' naughty. A milk chocolate and a white chocolate version. Now I'm pretty confident to say that Biscoff is the next Nutella. It's the next dessert spread. We had peanut butter everything in the 2000s, then Nutella, and now it's all Biscoff. But I always wonder, what's next? Personally, I'd like to see this shit return as the dessert spread of choice, all like a bueno filling, like a white choc hazelnut. Anyway, let's get into it. Starting with the milk choc, and only three in a box. So for $9.50 full price, that's $3.20 in ice cream, which is pretty pricey when you're buying from Woolies and Colors. You usually expect when you're buying bulk, you get a bit of a bargain. Anyway, let's go. I honestly can't believe this. I think I've just eaten the perfect ice cream. That's a 10 out of fuckin' 10. It is Biscoff flavored ice cream, Biscoff spread around the outside and cookie crumbs through it. It works so fuckin' well. It brings a tear to my eye. That is fuckin' naughty. Let's see if the white chocs is good. Okay, this one's good, but it's a bit of an anticlimax compared to the milk choc. It's a bit too sweet. You really need that milk chocolate to balance it out. I'm gonna give this one an 8 out of 10. They are still both very fuckin' naughty.
