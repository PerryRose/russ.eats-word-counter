Righto, KFC has brought onion rings to the menu with the new onion barbecue something burger. Now I fucking love onion rings, I've got a funny story about it, but firstly I want to say thank fuck KFC stealing some shit from Hungry Jacks after Hungry Jacks has stolen half their menu. Anyway, back to the story. We had a game called Fart Footy from year 7 to 10 at school. You basically got points for different types of farts and different combos, blah blah blah. Now the first ever banned performance enhancing prohibited substance was onion rings. My mate Blake had them the night before, cleared numerous classrooms, we had to have a fucking judiciary at recess where they got banned from school forever. You couldn't have them. Now onion rings on a burger can be good or bad. The Macca's Angus one was fucking dog shit, but the Smokehouse and the Rodeo on Hungry Jacks, aw. Let's do it. So it's got a new barbecue sauce, cheese and onion rings. Let's go. And the ring by itself. Okay, can't fault the onion rings. 8 out of 10, they're a fucking good onion ring. But on the burger, there's a bit much going on. The barbecue sauce is awesome, but it overpowers the onion. You only get a little bit at the end. So I'm gonna give it a 7 out of 10. It's a good burger, but I was expecting just a little bit more onion.
