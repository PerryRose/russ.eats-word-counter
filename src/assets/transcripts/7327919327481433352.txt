Righto, KitKat cookie dough has returned, I only really care about the chunky, for some reason the blocks don't hit the same as the chunky. I'd probably say the KitKat chunky is my favourite range of chocolate bars, these were my favourite, the chunky 3 with all different textures in each piece. Then in recent years we've had these absolute fucking delights, treat of the year 2022 up there. And don't even get me started on the imports, and this is only scratching the surface of KitKat chunky history, it's obvious I'm a big fucking fan. Let's do it, and I find it weird that there's two cookie dough things released at the same time, there must be a spy in the food industry, cause this always fucking happens. Anyway, the normal block, and the chunky. Okay, that's the middle of it, as usual the normal block is shit, you don't taste anything but a normal KitKat. But the chunky, you definitely taste something different, but it's kind of like a sour cookies and cream flavour. I don't know if that's what I remember the cookie dough tasting like, but I'm a little bit disappointed, so I'm gonna give that a 5 out of 10, I'm only gonna give this one a 6 and a half.
