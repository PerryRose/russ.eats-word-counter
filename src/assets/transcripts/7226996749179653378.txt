Righto, we're doing the Ferrero ice cream, two reviews in one day, I've just, I've finally got energy, I've been like Grandpa Joe in bed for the last four days, and this, this has been my golden ticket to get my fucking ass up. Speaking of Grandpa Joe, I used to look at this scene and just think that would be one of the filthiest dutch ovens of all time under that doona, just four old cunts just farting all day every day, that makes me sick. Now I want to mention that this was twelve bucks for four, and they aren't big, have a look at that, that's a fucking little lollipop. That is, that's, that's a fucking piss take, but this better be the best thing I've ever eaten in my life. Okay, so it's fucking tasty, it's exactly like you'd think it would be, except it does have a little bit of Nutella through it, but I feel like it should have been like the Magnum Ego, absolutely lathered in fucking Nutella, I'm going to give this an eight and a half out of ten because of price and not enough Nutella.
