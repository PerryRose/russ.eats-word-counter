Righto, just when you thought the party in the freezer section had finished, I've spotted these. Yes, I spent $31.50 on three boxes of ice cream, but I've got no fucking regrets. Berry Rebellion Tart, Lemon Meringue, and Passion Fruit Panna Cotta. I think that's how you say it. Now, you might remember, I wanted products to be named after actual bakery items that we eat, and our prayers have been answered with one. I'm still waiting on a Neenish and a Custard Tart snack, though. That's what we need. Also, a quick shout-out to these fuckers, seeing as I'm reviewing a bowl of products. They are amazing. Starting with the Lemon Meringue, seeing as I'm most keen for that one. There's the guts of it. Overall, it's pretty well-balanced. I wouldn't mind a little bit more tang, but you can really taste, like, the fucking crumbing of the tart throughout the chocolate. I'm gonna give that an 8 out of 10. I'm pretty happy with that one. Then we've got the Passion Fruit Panna Cotta. That is Simpsons Yellow. Wait, give us a sec. Proof. That is fucking proof it is Simpsons Yellow. I don't even know if I want to eat this anymore. Okay, listen closely. If you like super sour with sweet, get the Sunlover. Personally, I like that way more, but if you just like sweet Passion Fruit, you'll love this. I'm gonna give it a 7, though, okay? Just a 7. The Berry Rebellion Tart. I'm not sold on that one. You get a super artificial berry flavour and then one-dimensional sweetness. I'm gonna give that one a 5 out of 10. Not sold on that.
