Righto, occasionally I do eat a piece of fruit every now and then and it dawned upon me when biting into my pink lady apple, who the fuck is buying any of the other apples than this god tier apple? Does anyone here by choice buy any of the other apples? In my 29 years of being alive, once, once at primary school I seen a kid bring a jazz apple to school and we daxed him and then bashed him. Is anyone here, and don't say Granny Smith as an ingredient, I'm talking as just a fucking snack. And before you try and argue with me, here's proof, two pink lady apples left and about a hundred of the rest because they're shit and if you eat them, you're shit.
