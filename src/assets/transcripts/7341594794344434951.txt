Righto, Old Gold Peanut Brittle. If you don't like old gold, you're just not old enough yet. You will. It goes baby, toddler, kid, teenager, young adult, old gold eater, adult, senior, dead. That's how it works. Me personally, I was an early bloomer. Could walk before I was 1, pubes before I was 12, and old gold before I was 22. Also, the Cherry Ripe block is fucked up. You've got to try that if you haven't. Let's get into it. So it's chocolate, peanut, crunchy salted caramel and honeycomb. I feel like it's going to work because you're going to have the bitter dark chocolate, the salty and the sweet. There we go. Cross section. Looks pretty boring, but let's give it a go. I've got a good bit. I'll double drop. So it's enjoyable, but the chocolate overpowers everything. I'm not getting a peanut brittle taste. Remember this shit that Daryl used to make? Doesn't taste like it at all. It's just like old gold with peanuts and like a little pop of salt every now and then. Pretty fucking average. 6 out of 10.
