Righto, what the fuck, what, why did no one tell me this was coming out, golden gay time oak, I just went to the shops to innocently get a little satie treat and I near fucking shit my pants when I seen this on the shelf, I had no idea it was coming out, let's fucking go. There's the color of it and it smells just like the crumbing of the gay time, let's go. I was on such a high and I think I over stimulated myself and now I'm really let down and actually a bit sad so it's just like vanilla and it's a bit boring and I'm gonna go to bed. 5 out of 10, good night. Just quickly my cat's drinking it, I'm back, I'm, I'm, I'm happy again. You like it? Come off it, you'll be getting sick again.
