Righto, Cookieman has launched into Woolworths with a new Red Velvet Cheesecake flavour. Yes, this is a paid promotion, but it's a fucking funny story, alright? So, Cookieman seen my review on their 7-Eleven cookies a while ago, and they reached out to me saying, would you like to do a promo for the Woolies blah blah blah. So we make a deal and they send me out this, right? They're all double boxes, so 12 cookies. 12 massive fucking cookies. Now, usually I'd say to Demi, don't eat these, I've still got to review them. But I just didn't bother, because there's no way a small girl can get through 12 fucking cookies in two days. You can probably see where I'm going with this. So two days after the cookies arrive, I come home on the Friday Arvo to pre-record this, because you have due dates and shit when you do a paid promo. I open the cupboard and she has polished off all but one fucking snickerdoodle fucking cookie. So I've had to hit them up for one pack of Red Velvet, so I can actually do the video. Anyway, the fuck part is, the Red Velvet finally arrives, and I actually came home pissed the other night, and got a little hungry, and I actually ate that one remaining snickerdoodle, so this is all I've got. Red Velvet cheesecake. Red Velvet is actually chocolate flavour for any of yous that are wondering, right? Fair bit of shit in the middle, let's do it. Yeah, that's fucking mad. That cheesecake filling is like no other. That's actually awesome. And the chocolate Red Velvet biscuit itself's mad. I actually don't give ratings in paid promos, so use your fucking imagination.
