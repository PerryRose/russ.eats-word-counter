Righto, the new Sunset Fizz Billsons. I never drink on a Sunday, and I promise ya, I was about to go on a jog, but now it's raining, so the electric blanket's on. I'm crackin' this fucker. Also, I'm a little bitch for a sexy can design. This gives me, like, vintage 1970s vibes. It looks like my fuzz pedal. It's also giving me Tiger off Tekken 3 vibes. Eddie Gordo's best friend. Fuck, I hated versing these two. They were so unpredictable. Anyways, what does Sunset Fizz taste like? Let's find out. Okay, this has fuckin' surprised me. This is easily in my top three. It is a sour orange, right? So it's like a tangy sunkiss or a carbonated tang, if you ever had this. I'm also getting, like, a sherbet aftertaste, like these sherbet bombs. I'm giving that a 9 out of 10. That is fuckin' mad.
