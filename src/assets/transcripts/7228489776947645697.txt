Right, aeroplane jelly milk. Mango, raspberry and lemon jelly flavoured. Now I'm very disappointed they didn't do a port lime flavour because this is the OG jelly flavour in my opinion. Now these milks are made by Bickford's who make you juice, cordials and that iced coffee. Like the only iced coffee syrup you can get in Coles. Now they upgraded their production facilities so that they could do milks, but they mainly did weird fucking plant milks. The only milk that you would have tried is Violet Crumble. Bickford's also made this and now they've moved on to fucking jelly flavoured. Anyways, let's get into it. Let's start off with mango flavoured. Okay, I can't taste the jelly but that is a liquid Weisbar which has me pleasantly surprised. I'm giving that 8 out of 10. If you like Weisbars, you'll fucking like that. Raspberry jelly. That one just tastes like these which is a 5 out of 10. Like a sus strawberry milk is the only way I can describe it. And lemon jelly. I really don't know about that one. Like I'm getting lemon slice or lemon cheesecake vibes. But I feel like it needs a little bit of twang. Like lemon meringue twang. I don't fucking know. It's okay. I'm just going to give it a 6.5 to play it safe.
