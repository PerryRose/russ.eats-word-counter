Righto, two new Billsons, Blue Hawaiian and Pink Clouds. Kicking off with the Blue Hawaiian, so this is a cocktail that has pineapple, coconut, rum, and blue curacao. Which is just Blue Vodka, basically. Let's do it. Okay, that is not a Blue Hawaiian, there is no pineapple or coconut. It is very naughty, but I'm fucking confused. I think it tastes like the brown Schweppes Creaming Soda mixed with Allen's Red Frogs or Raspberries. I'm gonna have to do some digging. That was fucking easy. Found this comment, it is Blue Heaven flavour, not Blue Hawaiian. And what Blue Heaven is, is vanilla raspberry. So I was pretty fucking close. I'm gonna give it an 8 out of 10. It would have got a 9, but because it's a bit misleading, dropping a point. Moving on to Pink Clouds, once again, this doesn't taste like Pink Clouds the lollies. It's actually Pink Marshmallow, but I already knew that going into it. So I won't deduct a point for this one. That's spot on, exactly what the pink one of these. It's not too overpowering. I thought a Marshmallow fizzy drink would be fucking absolute piss, but I think that works. Give me campfire vibes. I've had a Marshmallow in ages, so yeah, 7.5 out of 10, not bad.
