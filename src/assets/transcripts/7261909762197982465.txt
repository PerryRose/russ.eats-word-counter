Righto, the new honeycomb sundae twirl, now the first thing that's pissing me off about this is that honey and comb look like two separate ingredients. Now this is directed to the graphic designer of Cadbury, it reads honeycomb sundae. Now I'm assuming it's not comb flavoured, honeycomb is one word. I won't be deducting points this time, but if you do some sort of grammatical fuck up like this again, you will be losing points. Also, who's head itched when they seen this photo? I can still remember the smell, nits were fucked. There was always a kid at school that had nits all the time, poor little stinky cunt. Anyways, let's do it. Okay, so it tastes exactly like a honeycomb ice cream, like hokey pokey ice cream. It's gorgeous, but there's one thing, the aftertaste is almost too sweet, like a bit of a chemical taste. Let me know if you taste it, maybe I'm just a bit fucked up today. I am feeling a bit weird, but I'm giving that an 8 out of 10. It would probably be a 10 if it wasn't for that aftertaste.
