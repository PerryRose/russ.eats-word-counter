Right-o, Australia is the first country in the world to get gold Maltesers But I'm scared Maltesers are a little late to the gold party and that gold chocolate in general is gonna fall victim to what I Call the salted caramel effect or the Tones and I effect where something gets so overdone that we all just start hating it Even if it's alright, if you know what I mean Anyway, now I'm keen as fuck on these because I loved white Maltesers And I feel like these are as close as we're ever gonna get to getting these back in Australia Also before I give these a go I want to go through the last four years of Malteser flavors Raspberry, vanilla shake, marshmallow, mocha, honeycomb, popcorn, caramel and I think dark come out before that But I need an eight for it to fit nicely in the collage Let me know which one you like the most and which one you thought was fucking shit. Let's do it Honestly, they are fucking gorgeous It's one of the best gold chop collabs I've had and it's because of the malt that works so well with the malt in the Middle I'm gonna give this a 9 out of 10 It would have got a 10 if it come out a year or two ago But it just it doesn't feel that exciting or groundbreaking because everyone's doing it But if you love gold chocolate give it a go before it falls victim to the dance monkey effect or whatever the fuck I called It earlier
