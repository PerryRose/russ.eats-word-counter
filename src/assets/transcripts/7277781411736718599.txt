Righto, two new bullets from Daryl Ease, Salted Caramel and Tropical. I love bullets, but this is a bullet that I don't like. Now, this, it's gonna be hard to explain, but this... ...is a vibrating device of this shape, and it was in my shed. Do you know how hard it was to explain to the boys that this isn't a vibrator? Like the show the receipt of darts online. It's a dart sharpener, by the way. The darts go in the top, you put two darts in, the vibrator's the bit that sharpens it. That's how I explained and got me out of trouble till they realised I didn't have a dartboard. Anyways, back to the review. Now, Daryl Ease brought out some average stuff, but I think they're the best in bullets, Rocky Road, and they were the best in Easter eggs. I don't know if they still do these, but these were half-filled Easter eggs. They were fucking so good. So, I do have pretty high expectations with these. I think it's the first bullets flavour in fucking years since, like, White Shot Raspberry. Anyway, Tropical first. Okay, that's probably the closest products I can compare these to, and I reckon these are way better. They're a lot weaker on flavour, which I think actually balances it, but you might think they're bland, and the way firmer bullet, they were way too squishy. Six and a half. And the salted caramel. Same deal, super weak on the salted caramel flavour, so if you're expecting a flavour that will blow your face off, you're going to be disappointed, but if you like a nice balanced sweet that's not too full on, I think you'll like them. I'm giving them a 7 out of 10. Yeah.
