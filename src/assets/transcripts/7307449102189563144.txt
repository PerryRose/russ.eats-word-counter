Righto, I've finally got my hands on a can, JD and Coke. Not Cola, fucking Coke. Now I've got some bad news, apparently this isn't coming out until 2026 in Australia. It's getting launched all around the world. They've also released JD and Coke Zero everywhere else in the world, but not here, because we're a bunch of fucking bitches that get absolutely nothing fun. Speaking of fun drinks we don't get, they've got hard Mountain Dew in America. Apparently it tastes like shit, but it still looks cool. And they've got hard Monster, which doesn't have caffeine, which kind of defeats the purpose, but it's better than the shit we've got here. Now these are 7%, so I'm going to mix JD and normal Coke at 7% and see if it's just a placebo effect. I reckon pre-mixed drinks taste better, but they probably don't, so let's do them side by side. Okay, start with this one, and the pre-mix. Okay, it's the best pre-mixed bourbon I've ever had because it's real Coke. That's always what lets them down, is that shitty LA ice fucking Cola, but it is exactly the same as the one I mixed myself. I don't know why I thought it was going to be different, so you're not really missing out on much. I'm going to give it a 7 out of 10 because it's just a bourbon and Coke. I wish it was a neutral base like the hard Solo. Like, imagine a hard Pepsi Max. I don't want to taste the bourbon, I just want to taste the fucking Coke. Also, I forgot to mention, I don't know why this isn't coming till 2026, if it's got something to do with the hard Solo controversy, or something to do with licensing. If you know, please comment below. Anyway, we're not really missing out on much.
