Righto, some breaking news. I want you to hear it from me first. The OG mashies are coming back to KFC next week. Not the fucking gravy-filled ones that came back about five years ago. The OGs. Now, I've actually known this since September last year. A worker sent me a photo of them in production. But it was this sneaky little photo from a KFC worker that got me most excited. Mainly these two letters got me excited. OG. I forgot about the whole debacle of them returning with gravy. They weren't the same. Blah, blah, blah. Look at that. Right in the middle, original. No gravy in the centre. Some more proof from another worker where they actually take your order. But what stood out to me is why the fuck are they running like Windows 95? They're one of the biggest fast food chains in Australia and they're still running this shit. No wonder they're slow as fuck. Also, this is a reminder. If you have goss, not food-related goss. I don't give a fuck if you're cheating on your missus. If you've got food-related goss, slide in my DMs. I'll keep you completely anonymous and I'll break the news. I love this shit.
