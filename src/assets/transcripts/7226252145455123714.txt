Righto, the new Cadbury Slices range. Now I'm really fucking crook with the flu but you can never be too crook for Choccy and I'm too excited to share with you this. I've been leaked the next Cadbury releases. Have a fucking look at this. Okay, we've got Vanilla Passion Fruit Slices and Caramel Slice. This one looks fucking amazing. We've got another Curtis Stones Raspberry and Hazelnut Tart. That sounds a little elegant and naughty. A Honeycomb Sunday Twirl. Fuck me. And it's not Cadbury but Pascal Hokey Pokey Lumps. These look fucking good. Anyways, let's get on with the review. Got it in an unboxing. Starting with the Caramilk Hedgehog. This is almond pieces, rice crisps and desiccated coconut. Smells amazing. Then we've got the Old Gold Mint Cream which is peppermint cream, crispy mint pearls and smells exactly like a mint slice and looks spot-on. Then we've got the Chocolate Crackle which looks exactly like the Crunch Block but has coconut through it. I've actually already tried this one by the way. Starting with the Caramilk Hedgehog. There's no biscuit pieces in this by the way. A Hedgehog Slice has biscuit pieces. This block has biscuit pieces. That's pissed me off already. Anyway, 6 out of 10. The ingredients work together but it's not a Hedgehog Slice. The Mint Cream. Nah, it's just like a normal peppermint Old Gold but with real sugary mint crunchy bits through it. That's fucking sus. Stick to the normal peppermint. That one's a 4 out of 10. And the Crackle. Personally, I give the Crackle a 9 out of 10. It combines my two favorite chocolate blocks, these, together. So if you like crunch and you like coconut chocolate, you will fucking love it. If you don't, you won't.
