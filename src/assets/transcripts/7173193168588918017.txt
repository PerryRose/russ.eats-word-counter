Righto, the hunt for festive piss continues. We've got the two new flavours from Bilsons. Now I've been obsessed with this brand ever since I tried this. My mate introduced me to it and I honestly nearly teared up. It's like a fruit tingle mixed with what I used to call a fire engine when you were young. I don't know what you guys called it. It was like a red drink. Anyway, have a look at it. This thing is incredible. In my top ten beverages of all time. Now I swear they're bringing out a new flavour every couple of weeks. They're making Vodka Cruiser look like a bunch of little bitches. Have a look at these. Vodka Cruiser has been absolutely shit lately. These have replaced them as my fruit beer of choice on Piss Ups. Now the Rainbow Sherbet. I'm so keen on this. I've rang nearly every bottle shop in Maitland trying to find this fucking bastard. That's honestly fucked up. That's better than the fruit tingle one. It is exactly like I thought it would taste. There's a reason I was so excited for this. And that's because the Yellow Zupa Dupa used to be sherbet flavoured and this tastes exactly like that. And that was my fucking favourite. I'm going to have to give this one a 9.5 out of 10. This is an incredible little tangy treat. Next we've got the Green Apple flavour. Cheers. That's exactly like the Green Apple Lolly flavour. It's a little bit sweet for my liking. I like a bit of tang with my Green Apple. Like that Granny Smith tang. But I'm going to give that one a 7 out of 10. It's not bad. So far it's looking like the Billsons range early on when you're around family. One standard drink. No risk of punching on. And then when I get my Christmas party shirt on and head out, I'll move on to the Apple Fireball. But all that Christmas food and sugary drinks, you'll need some fucking quickies. That's a reflux recipe.
