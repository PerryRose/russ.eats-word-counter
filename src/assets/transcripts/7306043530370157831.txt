Righto, Snackology episode 6, we are diving deep into the biggest junk food scandals in Australian history. New and improved shapes. In March 2016, we woke up with this behind me, our new shapes range. Arnott's had tampered with 5 Australian icons. Now firstly, this was not a publicity stunt. Arnott's spent so much money on R&D to improve the flavour technology. Proof of that is behind us, before 2016, the flavouring was only on the top of the shape. Whereas the new and improved shapes, and most launches since then, are using the new and improved technology with flavouring on both sides of the shape. Now where did this go wrong? It's like taking candy from a baby. They didn't give us choice, so they caused outrage by taking away something that we had like a nostalgic attachment to. This happened with Coke in the 80s, I don't know how they didn't fuckin' learn from that. It's also happening to V right now. Now these didn't fail because they tasted like shit. People just jumped on the outraged bandwagon. They weren't even trying them, and an example of that is the amount of complaints for Chicken Krimpy tasting like shit, when they never fuckin' touched the Chicken Krimpy recipe. They also never touched Savory, but no one gave a fuck, because no one bought them anyway. Another example is that they re-released new Pizza and Barbecue, just in a different box as these two below me, and suddenly people loved them. The difference was, they had a choice this time. In the end, they did a backflip and brought back all of the originals, except Nacho Cheese. That is still the one from the new and improved range, which personally, I like way more.
