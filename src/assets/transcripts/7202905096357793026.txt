Righto, the Rust Dot Easter Egg Hunt continues with the Splice Egg. Now, I've been on a journey to find the Red Splice. I found photos of the Orange Splice. There was a Pine Orange as well as the original Pine Lime. And then I finally found a photo of the Red Splice, but it didn't look right. It wasn't what I remembered. Until I seen this, and I thought, maybe it wasn't a Splice that I remember. Maybe it was one of these weird oval fuckers. It was starting to make sense, so then I started googling this name. And bam, there it was, the Red Berry Solero. Do you fucking remember this? This is one of the most fucking incredible Ice Block Ice Creams of all time. This shit on the Splice. Anyway, let's do it. I'm back on topic now. A creamy white chocolate egg bursting with a zesty Pine Lime crunch. Let's get into it. There it is up close. It reminds me of the Egg Thief. Remember the Spyro the Dragon? This little fucker that used to run around and steal the eggs? That's what this reminds me of. Anyway, let's go. That's the best of the eggs so far. Pretty accurate to the name too. Typical white chocolate up front. Then you get these crunchy, slightly tangy pineapple fucking lime lolly bits. Not bad. Seven out of ten for this one. If you love Splice and you love fucking... yeah.
