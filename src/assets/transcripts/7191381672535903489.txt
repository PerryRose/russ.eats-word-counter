Righto, now I'm a bit hungover and I was craving a shitty fast food chicken burger. Now I've always wished Macca's and KFC would collaborate on this because there's something missing on each burger. The McChicken, everything else is better except the actual chicken. It's a fucking processed, bland, sad piece of shit. And then the KFC Zinger burger has awesome chicken, but it tastes fake or it's always stale or something. So Russ Eats Creations, let's join him together with the McZinger burger. Also, I googled McDonald's cross KFC for a photo and there was some weird fucking shit. Look at this, a shirtless Colonel kissing Ronnie Mac. Then we've got a Ronnie Mac fishhook. Like who the fuck makes this shit? Someone's actually taken the time out of their day to draw this, which freaks me out. Here it is, the McZinger combo. I went for the KFC chips and a Pepsi Max. Have a fucking look at it. It just looks like they are meant to be together. That is gorgeous. Let's fucking do it. Let's do this. It's as good as I think it's going to be. Seriously, this is one of the most beautiful fast food things I've ever eaten in my fucking life. Both burgers are kind of average on their own, like they're missing something, but when you merge them together, it creates something truly fucking special. I'm giving this a nine out of 10. Fucking try it. Only reason it doesn't get a 10 is because they're inconsistent as fuck, so they'll probably fuck it up somehow if you try it, but they didn't fuck mine up and it's gorgeous.
