Righto, two new ones from Billsons, again, Cake and Lemington. Now, I'm not big on dessert flavours in fizzy drinks, and also, I'm just not big on cake and lemingtons in general. My true hate for cake started when I worked on this project in Queensland, where they also made lemingtons jam rolls and that, and there was no caneen, no burritos, and I didn't pack my lunch, so all I ate was cake for like seven days. I can't even go in this fucking aisle anymore, it makes me sick. Also, I forgot about this, it always makes me laugh, this wasn't inspired by Mint Slice, this was inspired by the last 30 seconds incognito mode. Kicking it off with the cake one, it's just a clear, slightly pink colour, awesome smell. Very accurate, that is cake, I'm getting like sponge jam and cream, but I don't know if that's a good thing. I'm gonna give it a five and a half, I could probably only have half of one of them as a little maybe post-dinner dessert treat or something. And the lemington, which is like a light brownie colour. Nah, I don't like the fake coconut chocolate flavour, I'm gonna give that a four, but then I went back to the cake, I'm gonna upgrade that to a six and a half. For a dessert drink, that is way better.
