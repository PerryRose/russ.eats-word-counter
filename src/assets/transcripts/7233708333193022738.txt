Righto, this isn't just a Mashies review, I've got more fucking food-related goss. When I told you about these, I asked for more goss and you guys delivered. I've got some bad news and some good news. Let's start with the good news. The good news is the Tower Burger is returning. I'll show you the proof in a second. This is two patties with a hash brown, an ass-clenching amount of grease, the hangover cure, the greatest hangover cure that has ever existed. Here's the proof. Tower Burger, between the 30th of June and the 10th of July, I've had about 20 other people confirm this, and also hash brown racks have come back to restaurants, so it's pretty much confirmed. Now the bad news. Normal Sunkist is gone, it's been replaced with Sunkist No Sugar, and Apple Juice, which is my girlfriend's favourite, has been replaced with sparkling water. There's rumours that they aim to replace all of their drinks with the Zero Sugar versions. If you're at KFC, why the fuck do you want Zero Sugar? It's absolutely beyond me. Unless you're diabetic, then I understand. Let's do the review. I've actually never tried these before. When they were out back in the day, I hated mashed potato, because my brother filled his mouth up with it and squished his cheeks together and pretended he was a pimple, and it used to make me sick. Anyways, we'll try one with the gravy, and we'll raw dog one. They're pretty good. They remind me of a McCain's Potato Smiley in taste, but a bit squishier, with that classic KFC flavouring, mad in the gravy, but I'm only giving them a 7 out of 10. And this is hard to explain, but we're spoilt these days. With all the shit in the frozen section at Coles and Woolies, with our air fryers, we have some fucking mad shit. Back in the day, you didn't have that, which is why these were so good, if that makes sense. Anyway.
