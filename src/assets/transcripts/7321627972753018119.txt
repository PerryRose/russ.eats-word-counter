Righto, it's a bit tense in the biscuit community. The whole orange slice debate has just caused some absolute fucking drama. So let's just move on and we'll talk about these, okay? Biscoff Creamed Biscuits. The new one is the milk chocolate, but we do have vanilla and normal Biscoff in the middle. Let's go. Now, I am assuming everyone knows this, but we all refer to Biscoff as this, right? The spread. But surely you know that Lotus is the brand, just like Arnott's is the brand, like the company, and Biscoff is just a biscuit, and that is Biscoff spread. Does that make sense? But where I get a bit confused is what Speculoos is, okay? So if anyone here is from fucking Europe, please let me know. I'm gonna start with the Biscoff Cream. That one's like a malto milk on steroids, which I'm all for, but it definitely suits like a coffee or cup of tea occasion, not something that you'll binge on, okay? One or two. The Vanilla Cream. Fuck me, these are little gilf magnets. If you bring these out at a high tea, you'll have the grannies coming from everywhere. That one is like a shortbread cream and a malto milk had a baby. Both are getting an eight and a half for like, they're a top tier bicky. And the brand new Milk Chocolate. Can it rival the Kingston? Not bad, but the Kingston's better. Very similar, but the Kingston's just better. So that one's getting a seven out of ten. Overall, they're fucking mad. Very malty, very Biscoff-y. I recommend if you're into your bickies.
