Righto, and good morning. I can't believe this. Stronger than triple espresso. How is this allowed on the shelf? My asshole quivered in fear when I come across this this morning. Now some quick maths on the caffeine. This is the final boss of a tradie's stomach. Level one is one shot, normal espresso. Then you got 1.44, 1.56, double shot, double espresso, triple shot, triple espresso. And then this monstrosity has 3.25 shots. 52 milligrams of caffeine. That is the equivalent of 812 milliliters of Red Bull in this fucking bottle. That is ridiculous. This is the final boss, the boss level. If you can have this with a cigarette and not shit yourself before Smoko, you get signed off your apprenticeship. By the way, the coffee bean intensity is flavor, not caffeine content. Just for your info, I got that wrong in an earlier video. Let's go. The highest caffeine concentration in any beverage on the Australian market that I know of. Let me know if there's another one. See, that's tasty as fuck. And that's what's dangerous about it. Just like cocktails, they taste so good and then you end up fucked. That's the story with this. It's like normal double or triple espresso with a stronger coffee taste. It's still a really sweet drink, but I'm going to give it an eight out of 10 for taste, but a four out of 10 for the idea of bringing something like this out to the Australian market.
