Righto, Cola Spider Zupa Dupa Move. Firstly, Oak already did this, it's one of the earliest reviews I ever did three years ago. I gave it a 5 out of 10. I said too much ice cream, not enough coke, but there was one positive. And this was the reminder that spiders were a thing. Seriously, these are one of the forgotten foods. I haven't had one in about fucking 15 years. Creaming soda was my favourite, but coke was also a treat. I don't know if spiders were a thing with the younger generation, but surely you at least remember the frozen coke float. Now this isn't the same as a spider, it tasted similar, but the fizzy drink with the cream made this weird fucking foam that was an absolute treat. Anyway, let's get into it. Here's the colour, but you gotta sip out of the carton for the full effect. That's fucked. That's almost undrinkable. It's not a cola spider at all, it is literally a cola Zupa Dupa mixed with milk. And it's obvious that's fucked. I'm giving that a 2.5 out of 10. Do not bother with that. That is up there with the worst milks I've ever had, and I've had off milk. I've had actual off milk, that's worse than off milk.
