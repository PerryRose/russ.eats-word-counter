Right, I have Solo Lemon Lime has returned for the 50th anniversary, but it's returned without sugar. This really pissed me off. Solo Lemon Lime was my favourite drink growing up. I could not get enough of it. When I seen that it returned without sugar, it really fucking pissed me off. Now Solo is one of the best drinks we have and they don't really bring out any other flavours. They've had the Lemon Lime and Extreme Lemon and that's all I can think of. Now I'm going to pitch a quick idea inspired by this Irish drink, the Club Rock Shandy, which is a mix of their Lemon and Orange. Solo should bring out a Fanta Solo Shandy. I think it would make an absolute killin'. Anyways, let's go. Initially it was off to a good start. It tasted exactly like I remembered, but then the aftertaste hit. The ending, and it just doesn't quench your thirst like the original. And the ending can fuck the whole experience. You asked Game of Thrones fans. For that, I'm giving it a 6 out of 10. It's not bad, but it's not the original.
