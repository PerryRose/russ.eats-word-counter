Righto, I was not expecting to make this as a video But it is that fucking good that I have to share it. If you're a licorice bullet lover, listen closely. Now where this has all come from is I'm going down to this licorice and chocolate factory on the weekend to meet up with the owners and stuff. I don't know what we're gonna do together. Hopefully something because it is a six and a half hour fucking drive. But anyway, I've been thinking licorice and chocolate. Then I seen Pauly V's video who wished that the cake and Lemington Billsons were milk based like a mudshake and I fucking forgot mudshakes existed. I was thinking a licorice bullet mudshake would be insane. So that inspired me to try and make my own. I've got this licorice liqueur and a mudshake tipped about 10 mil in the neck and holy fuck that is a liquid licorice bullet. It is insane. Only negative is you will shit your pants if you have more than two, but fuck me. Some more alcoholic milks would be a pretty good idea as a little dessert drink. Fucking get into it.
