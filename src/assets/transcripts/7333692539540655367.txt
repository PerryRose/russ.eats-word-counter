Right, I've got some fucking big news. I'm actually at a Bucks party, so that's how big this is. I've taken a break from the boys for this news. Speaking of the Bucks, look how fucking fancy this place is. It's fucking four stories, and this is the best bit, they have Ozstar. Not Foxtel, Ozstar. I will be watching King of Coins tonight. Fuck up, Aaron. So yeah, the Pollywaffle is back in bites form. It's bittersweet. The actual Pollywaffle can't be recreated. There's going to be a whole news article that's dropped. Read into it. I can't be bothered. I'm fucking pissed. But anyway, Pollywaffle bites are back. They look fucking mad. So yeah, rip in and enjoy. Thank you. Bye.
