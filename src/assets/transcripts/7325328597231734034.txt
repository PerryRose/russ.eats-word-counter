Righto, Billsons have entered the whiskey world with a butterscotch and apple pie whiskey, which I'm excited for, but I'm most excited to put Billsons head-to-head with the OG. The Guava Cruiser, which is probably the only cruiser that I think is absolutely gorgeous, so I've been waiting for Billsons to give this a crack. Let's see if they do it justice. Speaking of Guava Cruisers, don't bother with this. I tried it live on Twitch the other night and it was fucking disgusting. Link in bio, by the way, if you want to see me try the B-sides that don't make the reviews. Let's start with the apple pie. Seven and a half out of ten, that's mad. It's like a censored version of this, so if you want an apple cinnamon flavoured drink that doesn't make you fight your family, drink that, but if you like fighting your family, go this all day. I forgot to mention there's also no hot aftertaste with the Billsons one. Butterscotch, the can looks like something off fucking Harry Potter. I'm gonna give that one a five and a half out of ten because I'm confused. There's parts of it that I love and there's parts of it that just confuse me that I don't like. It's definitely like a butterscotch caramel with a refreshing whiskey aftertaste, but I don't know. And what you've all been waiting for, the guava. Fucking hell, that's easier to drink than the Twister. That was always my number one because it wasn't as sweet and you could punish like fucking eight of them. That is up there. Eight and a half out of ten. It's actually quite real in guava flavour. I thought it was gonna be more like the Rockstar and Lava Guava Mother, but it's not. That's fucking... They have done well head to head with the Big Dog.
