Righto, brand new segment, low-key treat of the month. So these are the treats that fly under the radar, because I always just do mainstream shit, right? Now, I want to get out of my comfort zone, so let me know some things that I should try. And they don't have to be new. They can be old, like these fucking treats behind me. They can be new, but something that I'd never usually try. Something a bit more innovative, like these two above me. And they don't even have to be good. They can be something like Halo Top, that I fucking hate, that I'm just going to do as treat of the month, just to let yous all know how fucking shit something is. And for September, Episode 1, we're doing Hoolies, the original onion flavor. So, these are what replaced Melts, which was the stinker of the year last year. The worst thing I've ever fucking had. They come in three flavors, sweet chili and smoky barbecue, but they aren't on the average. It's these ones I want to talk about. Let's have a look up close. So it's an extruded corn snack, just like a burger ring, and the ring itself tastes just like a burger ring. It does say have it with guacamole. Don't do that. That's fucking weird. Now, the reason these are so good is the flavoring. It reminds me of KFC chips, extra salt. Super salty and onion-y, makes your mouth water. One of the most addictive snacks I've ever had. Personally, I'm giving them a 9 out of 10, and it makes me sick that Melts came out over these.
