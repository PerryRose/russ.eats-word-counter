Righto, the low-key treat of the month for this month is caffeinated gum. This caught my eye at the servo this morning, what the fuck. Seriously, we've gotten that lazy, they turned food into drink, and now they're turning drinks into basically a tablet. I reckon in the future we won't even eat food or drink, we'll just have like a fucking pile of tablets that we eat or, you know. Now what really caught my eye is that it was $8 a pack, a $1.60 a piece of gum, which is fucked in the gum world, but it's 80mg of caffeine per piece, equivalent to this behind me, so I guess it's okay, it kind of makes sense there. Now I have a bit of chewy after my coffee anyway, because my pet hate is fucking coffee breath, stinky breath, fucking cunts over your shoulder, I hate it. So this is kind of cutting out the middle man, but that means nothing if it tastes like shit, so let's go. There it is, it looks like a mini scone and it says liquid core, let's go. Okay, after a minute the chewing gum is really good, but in the caffeine world, we do some fucked up shit to get a caffeine hit. You got Lion's of No-Dos and Macca's Coffee down the bottom, and Monster Ultra up the top. This is somewhere here, like a 6, 6.5. For taste though, if you're a spitter, this ain't for you, but if you're a swaller, you'll be fine. The first two gulps or swallows are quite chemically okay, they're alright, but they're like, it's definitely caffeine, you can taste it. Then the first minute, you feel like your mouth a little bit numb, almost sour, but then it goes away.
