Right, two new Pringles flavours, Chipotle Sour Cream and Cajun Spice. I've also seen this on Wish, it's to help you get the Pringles out of the can, which is really cool, I think. Anyways, Pringles have been hit or miss. These were mad, these were the worst fucking things I've ever tasted in my life. I had three, and I wanted to fucking kill someone. Anyways, let's see how they make me feel this time. Chipotle Sour Cream. That's the best fucking Pringle I've ever had. Sour Cream are my favourite, and is that on roids. Imagine Sour Cream, but with an American Chipotle flavour, and a bit of spice. That is fucking, nine, nine and a half, nine and a half. And the Smokin' Cajun Spice. What the fuck, I forgive you Pringles for the five years of dog shit you've served us. These are amazing, awesome Cajun flavour, makes your mouth water so much, and a fair bit of heat. That fist thing that you're supposed to use to get the Pringles out, I'm that excited, I'm putting it in me arse.
