Righto, the KFC brekkie wrap on the secret menu, yous have all asked for it, and I wasn't gonna do it because in my opinion, it's not a brekkie wrap if there's no egg. It's also not a brekkie wrap if you don't open till fucking 10, but whatever. Also, this isn't the first time KFC has done breakfast, I mentioned this in my junk food graveyard, but they didn't add chicken to any of their breakfast shit, so it was absolute trash. I have always said it, if KFC brings out bacon, eggs and fried chicken, I'm going there. I'm going there every weekend. For the true breakfast effect, I thought I'd stop in and get a Gut Buster. Apparently this is a Pearl Servo now, not a BP. I was gonna go to Triple Gut Buster, but it was on special for the ice break, so I just went with that one. Then to the Colonel, here we are. Hi, what can I get for you? Hey, order number 133032. Then, I thought, I've gotta add an egg, it's not breakfast without an egg, I've already went over that, and I fucked it, I'm not a cook, I'm a snack man, okay, yous know that, I'm not a cook, and it looks pretty fucking good, have a look at that, cheese and all. Let's do it, a few bites without the egg first. Now with the egg. 7 out of 10 without the egg, it's nice, but it's not a breakfast wrap, but I'm telling you, if KFC adds egg and iced coffee to the menu and opens earlier, they will take over the fast food brekkie scene. With the egg, 10 out of 10 by the way, one of the best fucking, exactly what you want, a bacon egg wrap with a filthy fucking chicken tender on it, washed down with an iced coffee, that was magic, that was one of the most magical breakfast experiences of my life, but without the egg, don't bother.
