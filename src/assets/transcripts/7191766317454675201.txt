Righto, Alan's inspired by Frosty Fruit and Drumstick. Now, these are a re-release. They aren't new. They came out five years ago in 2018, and I don't want to spoil the review, but they were fucking shit. But, I like olives now. I've grown up a bit. Maybe it was me. I thought I'm gonna give them another go because so many fucking people asked me to try them, so let's get into it. We'll start with the Frosty Fruits. We've got the Tropical Summer Sunset and Watermelon Slice. Let's go. Okay, they're not as bad as I remember. The Tropical one, that's a six and a half out of ten. It's nice, but it's not on the same level as the actual ice block. That is a fucking elite ice block. Summer Sunset, this one's shit. This one's a three and a half out of ten. It's just bland, boring. It has like an orange rind aftertaste. The Watermelon one, that's a six out of ten. It's nice, but there are way better watermelon lollies out there. Let's do the drumsticks. Here we've got Classic Vanilla, Super Choc, and Boysenberry Swirl. Let's go. Nah, they're probably one of the most bland, sad fucking lollies I've ever had. It's like chewing on a scented eraser from Smiggle. That's the only way I can describe it. They are just, oh, they make you kind of feel sick. The Boysenberry one has an okay aftertaste, but I'm gonna give them a two out of ten. They're fucked.
