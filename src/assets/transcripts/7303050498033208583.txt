Righto, The Junk Food Graveyard Part 13, we're doing ice cream, we're gonna have to do a couple of these by the way, there are so many memories, we are diving fucking deep. Kicking it off with home ice cream, there was nearly a punch-up every time they used to ding the fucking bell in my street. You would beg your parents for money and just raid their wallet and get all the coins out of the bottom of mum's handbag. Apparently they still exist, but I haven't heard the bell ding in my neighbourhood in about 15 years. The go-to in my family were these Milky Mates. They were pretty shit, but there was fucking bulk value, but the jelly top and the double crunch is what we'd get when we were lashing out. Next we've got the Double Gum Monster, this took over Bubble O' Bill in my family because it had two bubble gums. There was one problem though, I don't know if you remember, but it always fell off the fucking stick. They even brought them back out where the packaging said, guaranteed to stay on the stick longer. So I ended up going back to Bubble O' Bill, then they were phased out. Now I've seen a few videos on these recently, but I can't leave them out. The Paddle Pop Thickshake and the Mud Puddle. This was one of the best fucking ice creams, but it was so disappointing that the mud didn't go all the way through. Also, a quick shout out to the Caramel Thickshake, okay? People were forgetting that there was two, maybe three flavours. There was also the Choc Mint Portrait that was super similar to the Mud Puddle, but obviously Choc Mint flavoured. I loved it. Then we had the Agro Cone from Wendy's. There's actually still a Wendy's right near me. I think there's two left in Australia. I actually never tried one of these because they fucking terrify me. It was the scariest looking thing. I hated them. The Time Out Ice Cream. This is the only photo I could find. We're just getting started. Stay tuned for part two. Shitloads more to come.
