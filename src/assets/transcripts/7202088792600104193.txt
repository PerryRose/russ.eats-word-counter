Righto, I have some breaking news, some fucking huge news. A company has reached out to me and they are doing a Russ Eats flavour on one condition that by law they must do whatever I choose. And that company is Billsons. One of the next flavours will be a Russ Eats flavour that I get to choose. So if I say they're going to make a Winnie Blues, Asbestos, Dynamic Lifter or Inner Thigh Chafing flavoured drink, they have to make it. Now I actually want to make this good. I want this to be bigger than Fruit Tangle in every bottle shop around Australia. I'm not going to take the piss but I was letting you know that I could if I wanted to. Let me know in the comments some of your ideas, we'll do a vote, let's fucking go. Now I've been brainstorming already, let me know if some of these sound good. In the lolly world I've been thinking Sour Straps, Jelly Beans, Red Frogs, Fizzy Gumballs, Gummy Bears or Party Mix. You know that smell of a fucking party mix when you open it? Chupa Chup or even a Kablooey or Starburst flavour. Or more along the lines of drinks that already exist like a Fire Engine, Blue Gatorade, Red Powerade, a Pornstar Martini, Vanilla Passion Fruit, the best, Mango Tango, Cherry Coke, Vanilla Coke, Sour Watermelon or even Ginger Lime and Bitters, sounds boring but these was fucking mad. Then I was thinking Ice Blocks, Glug Cola Sunny Boy, Paddle Pop Cyclone or Desserts, a Lemon Meringue or a PAD, a PAD flavour maybe, I don't fucking know. Then I was thinking maybe we get unique as fuck with one of those flavours that the name doesn't really make sense like Bling V, Voodoo Mountain Dew, Kaboom, Starlight and Dream World Coke or Metamoon Prime if you know what I mean, I don't know, just trying to get creative.
