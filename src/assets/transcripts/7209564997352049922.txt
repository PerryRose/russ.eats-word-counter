Righto, The Forgotten Foods Part 2. These are forgotten foods from our childhood that actually still exist. Today we're doing Melody Pops. Now my parents told me these were discontinued, which was another fucking lie. Just like they told me it was illegal for the light to be on in the inside of the car while you're driving. So I was in absolute shock today when I seen these. They're nowhere near the other lollipops by the way. They're underneath all the chocolates on the bottom shelf. Now there is a reason I think my mum and dad told me these were fucking discontinued. And that's because the Melody Pop is the single most annoying piece of confectionery ever fucking made. Seriously, these are the sole reason that my mum and dad wrapped a wooden spoon across my ass crack and a Hot Wheels track across the back of the leg. These are fucked. If you have a friend with kids that you fucking hate, give their kids a couple of these and watch their whole family fall apart. Seriously, listen to this fucking thing. Wait. I'm gonna fucking wait. Lucky I bought two, that was a fucking dud. Imagine three kids running around the house making that fucking noise. It would test any parent's patience to the absolute limits. Melody Pops, you can get absolutely fucked.
