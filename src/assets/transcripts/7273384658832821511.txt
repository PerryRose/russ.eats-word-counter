Righto, Vodka Cruiser Cocktails. Tiny little can, 1.2 standard drinks, but they're 5.5%. Now UDL did this a while ago, and they were absolute dogshit, so I don't have high hopes for these. Let's kick it off with Margarita. It's trying to simulate this cocktail above me. It never ever does. The pre-mixed cocktails never do. Also, this is supposed to have a salted rim. I have been for a swim at the beach, so I technically have a salty rim, but anyway. 4 out of 10. Tastes like shit tequila in a Sprite. That's the only way I can describe it. The Passion Fruit Daiquiri, however the fuck you say it. Okay, I thought I'd show you the actual cocktail. It tastes nothing like that. This tastes like a 5.5% Posito, which is amazing, but it's nothing like the cocktail, so I'm going to give it a 7 out of 10. And the Cosmopolitan, which says raspberry flavour. A Cosmo doesn't have fucking raspberry in it. Anyway. It's not horrible, but it's not a Cosmo. 6 out of 10 for that one.
