Righto, the new Loaded Leamington Mars Bar. Loaded Leamington, the ones filled with jam. The next-gen Leamington. Personally, I think a Loaded Leamington's a bit much. I like to keep jam away from my Leamingtons. If I'm having jam, I want it in a jam roll. Nice and simple. I've eaten so many of these fucking things, by the way. If you were to unroll every jam roll I've ever eaten and put it end-to-end, I reckon three kilometers easy. There it is. Just a normal Mars bar, but the flavorings in the nougat. Also, let's keep the mind healthy. How many jam rolls end-to-end to wrap the equator? Let's get some maths going. It's okay. It's like a jam-flavored Mars bar, and then you get like a coconut aftertaste, but it's missing those little bits of coconut through it. So I'm gonna give it a 5 out of 10 because it's not a fucking Leamington without shit being stuck in your teeth.
