Right, hey, the return of the Malteser McFlurry, I wasn't going to review this because it's just a chocolate sundae with some fucking Maltesers thrown in, but I felt like being naughty and I needed an excuse for a little sweet treat, so this review is just an excuse so I can have a little fucking naughty treat. Yeah, what can I get for you? Can I get the Malteser McFlurry? Yeah, was that with vanilla or chocolate ice cream? What do you recommend? Better with the vanilla or the chocolate yum-yum? I recommend the chocolate. Yeah, let's do that. I'm stuck at the roundabout, but let's have a look at this chocky yum-yum, and what's this funky little song in the background? It's getting me in the fucking mood. Fuck this roundabout, bud. Let's do it. They're fucking hard. It's all right, it's nothing spectacular, the standout is actually the chocolate soft serve with the hot fudge, I reckon that's a match made in heaven, and the Maltesers, they go really fucking hard because it's cold, which I don't know if I like or hate, but it's still a bit sus, and it nearly broke my fucking tooth. Overall, I'm going to give this a fucking 6.5 out of 10, it's nothing special, but the chocolate soft serve with the hot fudge, that is something special.
