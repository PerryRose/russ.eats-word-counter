Righto, I'm not fucking around this Friday Piss Review, I'm doing Battle of the Bourbons double service because I actually want to ta- I want to feel the burn. Now a fun fact before I start is that Ned technically isn't bourbon, it's Australian whiskey. To call it bourbon you have to make it in America, but other than that it's exactly the fucking same. But I wanted something homegrown to go against the big dogs. Here's some quick stats on how big these dogs actually are and who owns them. Kicking it off with Woodstock, the Gateway Bourbon. Instant flashback to when I was like 15, eh? Like, it tastes like losing your virginity or Thornton train station. Moving on to Ned, this is actually named after Ned's declassified school survival guide. Let's go. Okay, this might sound stupid, but this one tastes more real, like not as fucking artificial as the Woodstock. You can definitely taste a lot more of the whiskey, but I don't fucking mind it at all. Moving on to Double Jack, and I'm not talking about a two-handed wank. Pretty standard, it kinda tastes angry. Moving on to Wild Turkey, how funny is this? It was the only one pointing out that it's vegan. Yeah, it's the only bourbon with a meat on the packaging, anyway. Really nice bourbon flavour, but the cola tastes fucking cheap and almost flat. The Jimmy. Probably my favourite so far purely because of the cola flavour. It's got a good fucking fizz to it, but it is the most expensive by far. Screenshot this for overall rankings in each category, but equal first I've got Jimmy and Ned. But they're either side of the spectrum. This one's affordable, this one's for rich people. This is if you want to taste the bourbon, this is if you want a sweet treat.
