Right I the return of the Kola wings at KFC now. I didn't try these when I ate in 2019 I heard they'll mad. I really don't think my guts are gonna put up with these I was at a box party or weekend and my toilet hasn't seen solid since I returned on Sunday So anyway, lucky I'm dedicated. I'm doing it for you guys They come in a very posh black box and they don't seem to have too much on them I thought they're gonna be absolutely covered. Let's give them a go. So it's only on one side very deceiving that pisses me off anyway Okay It's not bad, but it's nothing special It's literally a wicked wing with a tiny drizzle of sauce and the sauce is super sweet It's like a chup-a-chup a Kola chup-a-chup meet sweet baby rays the main letdown You know when you go out and get wings and they're fucking covered in shit like your buffalo wings and your sticky wings I felt like this was supposed to be like that Which is really letting me down five out of ten just stick to wicked wings and choose your own barbecue sauce at home
