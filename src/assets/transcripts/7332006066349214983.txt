Righto, I'm only doing this review to complain about our lack of fucking fun Oreo flavours. Berry choc top. Like come on, look what they've got overseas. Cherry cola, waffles, blueberry pie, fireworks. They've even got hot chicken wing and wasabi, which sounds like shit, but at least it's something different. Swedish fish, root beer, hot and spicy cinnamon. That does remind me, cinnamon from schoolies, if you remember me, I love you. The only one I wouldn't try is the mystery cream. Fuck, you can get some mystery cream from a hole in the wall at the Newcastle Ocean Baths, but I would not recommend. Anyways, let's go. It has a very familiar smell. Okay, that's the fucking smell, okay? Strawberry extra. Also, you can see how sweaty I'm getting. It's fucking hot in this room, so let's get it over and done with. Oh. Nah, I've ruined it for myself because of this fucking gum smell. It's like you're having an Oreo with a piece of that in your mouth, which has ruined it for me, and it's now going to ruin it for you, because I fucking pointed that out. So it's a 4 out of 10, but if I didn't draw this link, I'd probably give it like a 6.5. That's annoying.
