Right-o, Splice Oak Pine Lime Flavour, so I feel like I've let yous down, so many people are asking where the fuck the review for this is, I've been on holidays, but I'm that dedicated on the review that I've gotten off the plane only an hour ago from Melbourne, driven to three servos to find this fucker, I haven't even unpacked, I haven't even fed the cat and the cunt's starving, seriously, check him out, he's at my feet right now just absolutely starving but I'm that dedicated that I'm going to get this review out by nine o'clock. There's the colour of it, the smell is just an absolute flashback, quick shout-out to the Splice by the way, if you couldn't decide between an ice block and an ice cream, the Splice was the fucking perfect combo, that's why I loved it, anyway, let's go, I feel bad I've just gotten home and haven't given him any attention, so I'm going to let him fucking have a little review, he's gone back for seconds, look at that little fucking milk chin, okay I'm pretty happy with that, I've been really disappointed with some of Oak's other releases but this is fucking accurate as, if you like Splice you'll love this, it's like a pine lime up front and then like a sweet vanilla aftertaste but it is pretty fucking sweet, I give this an 8 out of 10.
