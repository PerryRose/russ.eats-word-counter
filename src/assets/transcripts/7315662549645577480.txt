Right, I was supposed to review this but I've already finished it because I fucking deserve it. I've had the worst day Okay, so I'm doing something a bit different I'm just gonna tell you the story and then we might get to like a like I'm in a bit of a different environment than Usual to because I just don't have time. I just can't be at I cannot be fucked I might get into a mini review, but I'll tell I have to tell someone this story I'm mowing the lawn getting ready for family Christmas as you do and I see this Maximus Esky So that one right there behind me. I see that and it's full. I'm thinking what the fuck's that doing? so I move it out of the way so I can mow and I open it up and Bugs fucking flies shit come all out of it. The worst thing I've ever smelt. I thought it was like a dead body part I honestly thought it was like an organ donor had left an organ here or something. It was I had no idea I scream I'm going Demi fucking what's this? Please come out here and she goes. Oh, no, that's from family Christmas I was like that was two fucking weeks ago Because yeah, I remember when my auntie gave me a heap of ham and chicken and I said, yeah, you threw that out because I remembered we left it in the car and I said fuck Demi That's all ruined now. We'll have to throw it out and she goes Yeah, I got it out of the car like you said, but she forgot to put in the bin So anyway, I've had Christmas meat just sitting in that Esky in 40 degree days for fucking anyway, it was fucked It was probably the worst experience of my life And for some reason we didn't just throw the whole Esky yet We threw the shit in the Esky thought we could save it But you can't the Esky's fucked and now the whole street smells like shit. So I'm sorry if you live near me There's flies so many flies now. I've fucking ruined Christmas Anyway, this is pretty good. It tastes like vanilla ice cream and two fruits Remember when you used to do that, but it's not what I expect a tutti frutti flavor to be But still pretty good seven out of ten, but it tasted like a ten after this fucking incident. Anyway, Merry Christmas
