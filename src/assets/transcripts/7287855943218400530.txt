Righto, the Whittaker's Hazelnut flavour has finally hit Australia. I only found this in Big W, don't know about Woolies and Coles, but it's in the fucking country. If you don't know what it is, it's basically Nutella-filled Whittaker's chocolate that was so popular in New Zealand, there was a shortage of other flavours, so I'm assuming that's why they didn't come to the country any earlier. Let's do an unboxing, because I love the Whittaker's packaging. It's one of the best in the game, and it should be for eight bucks. And have a look at the filling, pretty fucking good. Let's do it, smells amazing. Okay, it's fucking good, it's an eight and a half out of ten, but I'm a little bit let down, because in my mind, the centre was going to be like eating a scoop of Nutella, where it's not, it kind of just tastes like a creamier version of the Cadbury Marble. It's good, but it's not like the best thing in the world like I thought it was going to be, so a little bit let down, actually.
