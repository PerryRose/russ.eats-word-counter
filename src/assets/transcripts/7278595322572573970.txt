Righto, Daryl E. Kampos Coffee Crunch Collaboration. Now, I'm gonna educate us on some coffee culture, a bit of a rule, alright? Now, it's pretty simple. If you go to a town where you don't know what coffee to get, look in. If they've got Kampos beans, it's a safe bet that it's gonna be an okay coffee. It's not gonna ruin your day, it's gonna be palatable. But, if you look in and they've got these beans, it's a safe bet that that coffee will ruin your day and it's gonna be the most fucked up, filthy, burnt piece of shit in those shitty white mugs, too. I hate those mugs. It's a safe bet that your day is completely fucked. Anyways, let's do it. The reason I'm keen on this is that all coffee-flavoured shit is usually modelled after international roasts because that's what performs best in, like, research sessions. But, this chocolate is actually targeted at people that have real espresso coffee. So, let's fucking do it. Massive fucking yes, but it's not for everyone. So, listen closely. If you like chocolate-coated coffee beans, you will fucking love this block. It's about a tenth of the price rather than these fancy-pants packets. And you don't get as much of the coffee bean grit stuck in your teeth as more chocolate. Massive yes. But if you don't like chocolate-coated coffee beans, you will hate it and think it's a gritty, coffee-fucking piece of shit. Eight and a half.
