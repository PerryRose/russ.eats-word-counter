Right I finally after one year of searching I found the crispy marshmallows from Kmart that everyone was raving about now when I was looking For these I was going in and then I'd end up not finding them But walking out with about a hundred bucks worth of pointless trash from Kmart that just fucking breaks in about two days So I started to give up but today he was looking for a present for someone's birthday tomorrow And I found in a lonely container in the lolly section Anyways, this is what they look like super artificial smelling half little fucking things. Let's get into them That's what I look like in the middle Fucking hair stuck to it. Yeah, I don't know whose hair that was But it wasn't mine and usually a hair wouldn't gross me out But I think there was a follicle on that one and that it makes me fucking sick Anyway, these are super interesting or I'm gonna try and describe them as accurately as possible So the crispy outside is a strawberry flavored sherbet very similar to this So it's crunchy dissolves in your mouth and then the inside is marshmallow flavored, of course But really chewy like the pineapple lump center not when they're cold when they're chewy. That's exactly what these taste like now Is that good they do taste cheap, but they are different to other lollies So they're super sweet bit tangy kind of addictive only give them an 8 out of 10 purely because they're different But they're not that good
